<strong>问：经济增长不是依赖于人口增长的吗？</strong></p>

<p lingdex="1">许多自由市场经济学家说，商业需要增长的人口来获得成功。但实际情况是，购买商品的是金钱，而不是人。</p>

<p lingdex="2">举个例子，如果你想在卖鞋方面做得出色，一个伊梅尔达·马科斯（Imelda Marcos，菲律宾前第一夫人，爱鞋成痴）要比乡下任何一个小镇更有购买力。如果没钱买鞋，穿鞋的脚的数量丝毫不重要。</p>

<p lingdex="3">商业繁荣不需要更多的人，是更多的人需要商业繁荣。</p>
</div>

<div align="center">
<strong>调整经济体系来适应增长的人口密度</strong>
</div>

<p lingdex="4">我们当代经济体系似乎只取决于不断增长的人口。实际上，在人口密度增长的同时，一些人获益而另一些人蒙受损失。在人类发展的过程中，所有非人类的生命都在蒙受损失，但经济体系忽略这些成本，因为这些损失并没有明码标价。所以，让我们只从经济影响来看一看。</p>

<p lingdex="5">一个庞大的可牺牲的生产力会使所有者获益，但是同样使劳动力处于不利地位。拖家带口的工人无法负担长时间罢工，害怕被永久替代。高待业率降低工资，而高劳动力需求会提高工资和福利。</p>

<p lingdex="6">新的住房项目为建筑工人们提供工作，同时获得投资者们对未来发展投入的更多资金。然而，大部分扩张人类居住地的成本，是由已经住在这片土地上的人来承担的：增加税收来补贴人口增长。随着优先权的转变，维护和升级已存在的建筑可以提供像开发新建筑项目一样多的工作岗位。</p>

<p lingdex="7">房东在人口增长的情况下可以获利更多，因为对出租单元的更多的需求，意味着更高的租房价格。房客会在人口减少的情况下获利，因为住宿变得更便宜。</p>
<p lingdex="8">

</p><p lingdex="9">炒房者通过所有权价值的攀升赚钱，而所有权价值被对所有权的需求所左右。在房子在市场里升值的时候，那些不希望变动的私房房主需要交更多的税。</p>

<p lingdex="10">Businesses which focus on the needs of infants and young people will have
fewer customers as birth rates improve, however, fewer customers doesn’t
automatically mean less income. Many potential consumers can’t afford the
products offered, and with smaller families, just as much money could be
spent on children’s products. Often, companies also cater to other age
groups, and money not spent on children’s needs is available for those
products and services.</p>

<p lingdex="11">Education may seem dependent on an increasing, or at least a steady flow of
new students. However, providing adequate education over-taxes local
economies, and many citizens resist paying. With fewer students, class sizes
could improve, and capital expenditures for new schools would shrink.
Existing schools could get their needed repairs and improvements. As with
diversification in other businesses, public schools could cater to wider age
groups and increase their customer base.</p>

<p lingdex="12">Chain letters involving money, and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/pyramid.htm">pyramid financial
arrangements</a> such as Ponzi schemes, are illegal, since they benefit the
first to get involved and collapse when there are no longer enough new people
paying in. Outlawed in the private sector, many government retirement systems
unsustainably depend on increasing numbers of wage earners to pay
entitlements. Systems dependent on growth eventually fail, as pyramid scams
and empires always have.</p>

<p lingdex="13">When our population density begins to improve, and sensible adjustments are
made, economic systems as a whole will become more sustainable and
potentially more just.</p>

we’re old?</strong> </p>

<p lingdex="17"></p><blockquote><em>The new demographics that are causing populations to age and to
shrink are something to celebrate. Humanity was once caught in the trap of
high fertility and high mortality. Now it has escaped into the freedom of low
fertility and low mortality. Women’s control over the number of children
they have is an unqualified good—as is the average person’s enjoyment,
in rich countries, of ten more years of life than they had in 1960.
Politicians may fear the decline of their nations’ economic prowess, but
people should celebrate the new demographics as heralding a golden
age.</em></blockquote>

<p lingdex="19">Despite the wisdom of the above quote, it is a rare expression of lower
birth rates’ positive side. Those who benefit most from an increasing
population density—identified in the previous Q &amp; A—also happen to
own or finance major media outlets. As a result, we are regularly told that
an economic crisis looms if we don’t breed more future workers. A
Washington Post reporter wrote of “countries struggling with the threat of
zero population growth.”</p>

<p lingdex="20">Although most systems of providing for retired citizens are financed by
taxing working citizens, the concept of needing younger people to support
older people is obsolete. If used responsibly, products from the industrial
and technological revolutions could satisfy our needs without selling our
children into wage slavery.</p>

<p lingdex="21"><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/190358/20110801/foxconn-hsbc-apple-labor-jobs-economy.htm">Automation</a> removes more workers from payrolls than birth control does. Owners

<strong>Q: Is conservation the answer to resource depletion?</strong> 

<p lingdex="29">Each new human we don’t create is the equivalent of more than 70 years of
100% recycling. We save over 50 years of car driving, avoid tons of
pollution, and prevent the potential for an additional procreation less than 20 years
later.</p>

<p lingdex="30">When the impact our <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFV-4V8FFCG-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=411a4bfd17ad84a0d2fd4c0a9061c717">descendants’
descendants</a> have on Earth’s biosphere is added to what we are saving,
it becomes astronomical. And, if we decide to not make two more of us, we
save astronomical doubled.</p>

<p lingdex="31">Volunteers who are ready to make even more of a commitment might consider
not producing 10 new people: 720 human-years of industrial consumption and
pollution can be saved by just one pair of us. Congratulations!</p>

<p lingdex="32">All kidding aside, and that’s a good place to put “kidding,” running out
of resources mostly concerns humanity, not the ecosphere. Conservation
usually means <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/we-must-preserve-the-earths-dwindling-resources-fo,11239/">use it up more slowly</a>. One conservation organization’s motto: <a href="http://www.nacdnet.org/">“Conserving natural resources for our future.”</a> Resource extraction disrupts ecosystems, so when a resource is all gone, life might start to recover there.</p>

<p lingdex="33">Many believe that Earth could supply an endless amount of resources.
“The Economist” magazine for example: “The notion of a growing number
of people fighting over a fixed resource pie is Malthusian bosh . . . ”</p>

<p lingdex="34">Cornucopian pie-in-the-sky might look tastier, but bosh is all we’ll be
able to sink our teeth into on a finite Earth.</p>

<p lingdex="35">Although humanity has reason to fret over material and energy shortages,
loss of wildlife habitat diminishes life far more, and we don’t even count
it. It’s not a resource if we can’t use it. Unlike copper, which the late
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffsimon.html">Julian
Simon</a> assured us could be made out of something else if we run out,
wilderness areas are definitely finite.</p>

<p lingdex="36">If we cut our per capita consumption in half and double our numbers, we’ll be right back where we started.</p>

<p lingdex="37"><a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/46892">Societal Overextention Analysis</a> adds economic overshoot to ecological overshoot for a more complete picture of our situation. </p>

<strong>Q: Isn’t over-population worse in poor countries?</strong> 

<p lingdex="42">There are two main aspects to over-population: the ecological and the human.</p>

<p lingdex="43">In countries with high birth rates and recurring famine, the impact on
humans is greatest. In countries with lower birth rates and high consumption,
the environmental impact is greatest. We need to work in both of these areas
to relieve human suffering and ecological degradation.</p>

<p lingdex="44">At present, a human born in the wealthy part of the world has a much
greater environmental impact than one born in a poor country. However,
activities of poor agrarian peoples also have an impact on the
environment.</p>

<p lingdex="45">Gathering firewood and grazing at the edges of deserts causes the deserts
to expand. Hungry people are kept out of game preserves in Africa by shooting
trespassers. As the number of hungry people grows, this gruesome task will
become more difficult. If a government is overthrown and the game wardens
temporarily removed, many major species could be hunted to extinction in a
short time.</p>

<p lingdex="46">Pollution from a crowded city in a non-industrialized country is
shorter-lived than from our industrialized cities. Chernobyl will be
radioactive for 24,000 years, while organic pollution will flush out of a
river in a few years.</p>

<p lingdex="47">So-called developing countries are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/18/china-average-europe-carbon-footprint">gaining</a> on industrialized nations in
their consumption of fossil fuels and production of toxic wastes. Much of
this industry is being imported from industrialized areas to take advantage
of cheaper labor. Cheaper labor is another result of high birth rates.</p>

<p lingdex="48">Whether we’re living abundant lives or are starving, our lives and the
planet’s health will be most improved by refraining from reproduction. <br>

<p lingdex="50"><strong>Q: Isn’t unequal distribution of wealth the cause of hunger rather
than over-population?</strong></p>

<div align="center">
<p lingdex="51"><img src="./static/multdivide.jpg" alt="" height="284" width="400" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p lingdex="52">Compelling evidence supports this contention. A small percent of the
world’s population is using most of the energy and resources. Equal
distribution, if possible, would likely end hunger for a while.</p>

<p lingdex="53">Setting aside for a moment the fact that people who aren’t created
won’t starve, the single greatest cause of hunger today is economic
exploitation. Instead of growing food, exploited regions must raise cash
crops to pay the interest on national debts. Profit from natural resource
extraction could provide for people’s needs if it weren’t for people’s
greeds.</p>

<p lingdex="54">More conservation by us consumption-addicts is only fair, but the lion’s
share of Earth’s plunder is <a href="http://planetsave.com/2011/08/28/who-runs-the-world-network-analysis-reveals-super-entity-of-global-corporate-control/">controlled</a> by a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2011/10/19/millionaires-control-39-of-global-wealth/?mod=wsj">fraction of one percent</a> of humanity.
Brute force sustains this ancient world order, same as it ever has.</p>

<p lingdex="55">Phasing out the human race won’t automatically bring about economic
justice, but it will make it possible. The smaller our human family, the
easier feeding everyone at the dinner table will be.</p>

<p lingdex="56">From an Earth-centered view, we’re pluckin’ a mighty skinny chicken
here, and it doesn’t matter to the chicken who gets the drumstick and who
gets the neck.</p>

<p lingdex="57">US Census Bureau’s estimated <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/popclockworld.html">number of servings needed</a> for today’s dinner table.</p>

<p lingdex="58">Although everyone on Earth could theoretically be fed, the fact remains that they simply are not. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11503845">A billion people</a> are not getting enough to eat, and around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger#Malnutrition_mortality_statistics">36 million</a> are starving to death each year—one third of them children. </p>

<p lingdex="59">In 1970, when the global human population stood at 3.7 billion, the main
architect of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_%28agriculture%29">Green
Revolution,</a> Norman Borlaug, said:</p>

<blockquote><em>“There can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until
the agencies that fight for increased food production and those that fight
for population control unite in a common effort. Fighting alone, they may win
temporary skirmishes, but united they can win a decisive and lasting victory
to provide food and other amenities of a progressive civilization for the
benefit of all mankind.”</em> </blockquote>

<p lingdex="60">Instead, all the increased agricultural yield has been <a href="http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=2c641635-c102-4aa7-af4a-c0a2a25aa7dc&amp;sponsor=">gobbled up</a> by population growth. Although the percentage of hungry people has decreased—from 37% in 1970 to 17% in 2007—the raw number of malnourished people has continued to increase. There are more hungry people now than the entire population of the planet was when Malthus warned of our population growing faster than our food supply.</p>

<p lingdex="61">Food production has almost kept up with us—or us with it—at a huge
<a href="http://politics.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2008/07/07/the-toxic-consequences-of-the-green-revolution.html">ecological cost</a>. Farming on performance-enhancing drugs produces more food, but it’s at the expense of long-term fertility of the soil. Now the UN warns that food production must <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/economy-and-business/UN-Calls-for-Doubling-Food-Production-125011784.html">double</a> by 2050 to satisfy nine billion people’s appetites. Estimated cost of boosting output: $1.9 trillion a year. That would buy a lot of contraception.</p>

<p lingdex="64"><strong>Q. Wealthy countries have low fertility rates, so why not just increase
a nation’s Gross Domestic Product and let birth rates fall naturally?</strong>
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="./static/tfrgdp.jpg"></div>

<p lingdex="65">The correlation between TFR and GDP shown above is often presented as
evidence that poverty causes high birth rates. It could just as easily show
that high birth rates cause poverty. Are people breeding more because they
are poor, or are they poor because they breed more? Many countries have low
birth rates and low per capita GDP, so other factors are likely involved.</p>

<p lingdex="66">A <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2010$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=295;dataMax=79210$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=">dynamic chart</a> from Gapminder shows TFR and per capita income over time.</p>

<p lingdex="67">Where there’s a cultural preference for large families, subjugation of

</div>

<div align="left">
<p lingdex="69">China’s improved fertility rate likely played a major role in improving per
capita GDP. Improvements have also followed lower birth rates in <a href="http://pacificxanh.wordpress.com/2010/08/08/vietnam%E2%80%99s-demographic-dividend-and-the-race-to-build-a-productive-economy/">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="http://www.population-growth-migration.info/essays/DemographicDividend.html">other countries</a>. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_dividend">Demographic Dividend</a> typically lasts a few decades and could serve as a transition from an economy based on growth to one with an improving population density. Short term planning, exploitation, and civil unrest often squanders this window of opportunity, as in <a href="http://sundaytimes.lk/110206/BusinessTimes/bt26.html">Sri Lanka</a>. </p>

<p lingdex="70">Models of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition">demographic transition</a> from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates generally assume that an increased standard of living, also called economic development, is the primary driver. Social improvements such as a higher status for women, reproductive health care, and increased education opportunities are given less weight than economic factors. However, lower fertility and subsequent lower mortality have been achieved without economic development in <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2011/05/bangladesh/belt-text">Bangladesh</a> and the Indian state of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_model">Kerala</a>. Also, families have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/apr/14/smart-family-planning-reduces-poverty">improved</a> their standards of living by voluntarily limiting their fertility. </p>

<p lingdex="71">In the last century, organizations bringing health care to poor nations dramatically reduced mortality, but reproductive health services were negligible and remain sadly inadequate. The result is a lag between improved death rates and improved birth rates, multiplying population density several times over. Now, many nations are caught in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_trap">demographic trap</a>, unable to provide adequate food and services for their masses, nor to improve birth rates. </p>

<p lingdex="72">Because wealthy nations have lower birth rates, it’s <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/14164483">assumed</a> that increased income causes couples to want smaller families. In reality, when couples perceive a better future they’re likely to have more children and to have them sooner. <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005067.html">US birth rates</a> fell to a historical low during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and rebounded with a Baby Boom during post war economic optimism. Migration to a wealthier region usually <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back1105.html">increases</a> a couple’s fertility.</p>

<p lingdex="73">Although economic justice demands higher standards of living for billions of humans, without other social advancements, fertility rates will rise with economic improvements—ultimately negating those improvements. </p>

<p lingdex="74">As globally-interdependent financial pyramid schemes fall apart, and wealth continues to be transferred upward, personal economic adversity is likely to lower birth rates in regions where contraceptives are available and women’s right to use them is respected.</p>

<p lingdex="79">Modern economies are still based on the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_and_burn">slash-and-burn</a> method.
This method assumes that there are unlimited resources and that unlimited
growth is possible. We know this isn’t true, yet we allow our economies to
be run as if it were.</p> 

<p lingdex="80">Slash-and-burn was sustainable for thousands of years in sparsely
populated regions. When a people returned to an area that had been slashed
and burned, the resources had recovered enough to do it again. We’re still
slashing and burning, but now there’s no recovery time due to our increased
numbers and subsequently shorter cycles.</p>

<p lingdex="81">Most modern industrial economies are dependent on large expendable labor
pools, availability of raw materials, scarcity of goods, and unlimited
wants.</p>

<p lingdex="82">A sustainable economic system is based on the reality of limits to growth
and a concern for long-term effects. Rather than using up resources and
throwing away the waste, a sustainable system conserves and reuses.</p>

<p lingdex="83">To keep the resource-exploitation machinery running, we are sacrificing
the planet’s true wealth: life itself. This insatiable monster seems bent
on consuming all life on Earth, and we are working overtime to keep it fed.
It feeds mainly on our offspring. We should let it starve.</p>
