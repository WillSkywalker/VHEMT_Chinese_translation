<p lingdex="0"></p><h2>Welcome!</h2>
<h3>
Hooray for Earth and humanity! <br>
VHEMT Volunteers and Supporters breed no more.</h3>
</div>

<p lingdex="1">A few billion more of us and we’ll save the planet once and for all.<br>
<br>
You may have already been a Volunteer or Supporter before hearing of the
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. Millions of people around the planet
have independently arrived at the conclusion that Earth’s biosphere would be
better off without humans. A little further down the thinking process and it
becomes apparent that decreasing births rather than increasing deaths is the
way to go, and voluntary methods are much more fun to advocate.<br>
</p>

<p lingdex="2">We Volunteers and Supporters make up our own minds about life and what to
do with it. Our diversity makes The Movement strong. A wide range of
religious, political, and social thought is represented among us.<br>
<br>
Even our unofficial motto, “May we live long and die out,” has room for
differing opinions: some prefer “May we live well and die out.” As
explained below, Supporters don’t agree with the “die out” part of the
motto.<br>
<br>
However, the first word in VHEMT is Voluntary. Although some who support
VHEMT may also advocate involuntary solutions to our population density
problems, they are not advocating for VHEMT when they do so.<br>
<br>
Loosely, we relate to VHEMT in one of three ways: Volunteer, Supporter, and
Undecided. <br>
<br>
<b>VHEMT Volunteer</b>: “All of us should voluntarily refrain from
reproducing further, bringing about the eventual extinction of Homo
sapiens.”<br>
</p>

<p lingdex="3"><b>VHEMT Supporter</b>: “Intentional creation of one more of us by any
of us is unjustifiable at this time, but extinction of our species goes too
far.”</p>

<p lingdex="4"><b>Undecided</b>: “Stop trying to put words in my mouth. Maybe I’m a
Volunteer and maybe I’m a Supporter. I’d like to know more before I
decide.”</p>

<h3>The Path of Progressive Awareness</h3></div>

<p lingdex="5">Because we’ve all arrived at our present awareness by different routes and
at our own speeds, this simplified, seven-step diagram might not fit anyone
exactly. However, this progression of awareness pattern seems to have
emerged. Maybe a two-dimensional chart will provide a little direction and
help us track the progress of ourselves and others.</p>

<center>
<img src="./static/path.gif" width="504" height="258" align="bottom"></center>

<ul>
  <li>0) Pre-awareness 
    <p lingdex="6">We all begin at birth, but our path of progressive awareness doesn’t
    begin until we grow beyond pre-awareness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>1) Shock. 
    <p lingdex="7">Shock is the first step in our journey of progressive awareness.
    There’s no returning to the blissful ignorance of pre-awareness once we
    receive our first shock of reality. Shock doesn’t last for long—it
    can’t. People won’t live long in a state of shock. For almost all of us,
    denial is our first reaction to shock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>2) Denial. 
    <p lingdex="8">Denial is a sanctuary from shock. This is a good time to stop and
    figure things out—to get emotionally and intellectually ready to
    continue the journey. Unfortunately, most people never leave denial. If
    you seem to be doing well with the way things are, what’s the problem?
    Living in denial robs us of peace of mind. Our conscience knows the
    nagging truth, and the anger keeps leaking in. When we stop denying
    reality, we are forced into the next phase—anger. It looks ugly and
    unprofitable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>3) Hopeful anger. 
    <p lingdex="9">Hopeful anger is a powerful, driving force which can keep us working
    hard for years. Unfortunately, it is also hard on our personalities.
    People have sacrificed their Selves in the battle to preserve Earth’s
    ecosystems, often becoming cynical and giving up hope. Then they move to
    the hopeless anger phase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>4) Hopeless anger. 
    <p lingdex="10">Phase four is home to the cynical and the misanthropic. The good
    aspect of this phase is that it allows many to consider human extinction
    for the first time. The bad aspect is that this option is usually
    considered without love. Famines and epidemics don’t seem so bad from
    this perspective. Anger is actually left over from denial. It means we
    haven’t fully accepted the situation yet. When we do, anger dies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>5) Hopeless acceptance. 
    <p lingdex="11">More depressing than hopeless anger is acceptance without hope.
    Without anger to keep us going, unrealistic hopelessness can be a
    short-cut back to denial or even to suicide. People in this phase might
    not be so hard to take if they would just shut up about it. If they were
    angry, at least there would be some excitement to their dirges. Though
    often necessary, this phase should be as short as possible. It’s hard to
    break loose from a lengthy depression. Perhaps just realizing that there
    is hope... allowing ourselves to see the signs of hope, which are all
    around us, will break the spell and allow us to move on to the hopeful
    acceptance phase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>6) Hopeful acceptance. 
    <p lingdex="12">Yes, there is still hope, and it will raise us out of the depths of
    depression. We can easily go too far, however. If our acceptance elevates
    into the clouds of mindless hopefulness, we will have lost some of our
    hard-learned awareness. Unrealistic hopefulness is socially graceful and
    more pleasant than some of the previous phases, but it too can be a
    short-cut back to denial. We must take the final progressive step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>7) Vehemence. 
    <p lingdex="13">With a VHEMT perspective we move forward in a dynamic balance of
    optimism and pessimism, aware that our reality is both hopeful and
    hopeless. Once we accept that humans are hopeless as a species, there is
    renewed hope for the survival of the planet as a life form. Although
    there will be times when we fall back to an earlier phase, a VHEMT
    Volunteer is less likely to swing to and fro from yin to yang like a
    yo-yo. With a balanced awareness, our efforts to preserve life on Earth
    will meet with more success, no matter what those efforts may be.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p lingdex="14">An additional note from Les:<br>
Reading Elizabeth Kubler-Ross’ stages of death in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684839385/qid=1138897868/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-1284210-4732059?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">On
Death and Dying</a></i>, I was amazed that it was so close to the typical
path of awareness in dealing with our “death” as a species. At the time, I
didn’t realize that Dr. Ross’ stages correspond more closely than my sketch
shows. “Bargaining” is a stage just before acceptance. Deals with God are
attempted at this point. I didn’t think it applied to VHEMT.</p>

<p lingdex="15">Over the years, I’ve shared with other Volunteers some of the many letters
I’ve received asking if there’s some way out of our extinction: go into
space, learn to live in harmony, invent a technological fix—something.</p>

<p lingdex="16">They had achieved an understanding of what’s been done to the biosphere,
and were done being angry about it, but weren’t quite ready to accept that we
must disappear. Then someone pointed out that this is the bargaining stage,
and it rang true.</p>

<p lingdex="17">Just as people who know they are dying sometimes do, we could live the
rest of our lives in the bargaining stage—hoping for a miracle to restore
ecosystems and stop extinctions.</p>

<p lingdex="18">It’s up to each of us to grow beyond these earlier stages. No one can do
it for us. A hopeful hopelessness awaits our increased awareness.<br>
