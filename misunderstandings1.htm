<h3>Misunderstandings about VHEMT</h3>
</div>

<p lingdex="0">Occasionally, visitors to the VHEMT website experience misunderstandings concerning The Movement’s purpose and goals. Fortunately, many have the good sense to email me with their concerns, and allow for some clarification.</p>

<p lingdex="1">I’ve selected some rather randomly to share with you, with my replies in between. I’m sorry I repeat so many phrases, they just fit so well. My replies include opinions which may differ from the opinions of some other Volunteers. No one speaks for everyone in The Movement.</p>

<p lingdex="2">The first half of the following were recieved and replied to prior to January 2001, and the second half were replied to after that, so figures won't be current nor consistent.</p>

<p lingdex="3">If you’re viewing in color, visitors’ words are in red. If not, they are marked with &gt; and &lt; at the beginnings and ends. Words within [brackets] have been added since the exchanges were made.</p>

<div align="center">
<h3>! ! ! Warning ! ! ! </h3>

<p lingdex="4">The following warning may be offensive to those who find these
warnings offensive.</p>

<p lingdex="5">Warning: Some of the words in the following messages may be offensive to those who find certain combinations of letters offensive. You have been warned!</p>

dramatic).</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="7">From Justin,</p>

<p lingdex="8">Thanks for taking the time to share your views on voluntary human
extinction, and for giving me the opportunity to clarify some finer
points about The Movement. I think we agree on some basic concepts,
we just go in differing directions.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="9">&gt;Listen pal, you need some serious help. I just got finished
reading your web page, and man, that’s some evil shit. On that “Would
you push this button?” part, I said, “No. I wouldn’t Push It.” And
under that, it said, “I can justify the existance of the human race
despite all the evidence,” or something like that, obviously
sarcastically.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="10">Yes, that’s my attempt to be humorous while at the same time
pointing out that, in light of the evidence, our species’ existence
can’t be justified.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="11">&gt;For your information, I can justify the existance of the human
race.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="12">Perhaps so. I was hoping you would give a justification or two
which I could consider. Or, do you mean the following is a reason we
should continue our existence?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="13">&gt;You say when we’re gone, ’we won’t be missed.’ Well, this is a bunch of bullshit, since no other animal besides us has the
intelligence to miss ANYTHING.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="14">I think we in agreement on this. After Homo sapiens is gone, there will be no other species capable of missing us. Therefore, we won’t be missed.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="15">&gt;We’re the only ones who have the capability to ENJOY this
planet.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="16">Well, this would be very hard to prove one way or the other.
Enjoyment is difficult to quantify for scientific analysis. From a
subjective point of view, however, it looks to me like lots of
critters enjoy their lives—like otters.</p>

<p lingdex="17">But, let’s assume you’re right. Even so, “capability to enjoy”
doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually DO enjoy this planet. If we
enjoyed planet Earth, I feel certain we would not be destroying
ecosystems nor be bringing about the extinction of more species than
at any time since the dinosaurs died out.</p>

<p lingdex="18">I agree we have the capability to enjoy and care for life other
than our own. That’s a part of the foundation of the VHEMT
philosophy. If humans had no ability to act out of selfless
compassion, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement wouldn’t have a
prayer.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="19">&gt;All the other living things are basically drones doing there job.
They are keeping this planet functioning FOR US.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="20">This major philosophical difference creates our divergent
conclusions. Many people believe that all other life was put here for
us, and often use religious texts as proof. On the other hand, I see
humanity as just another species in the web of life—true, a very
special species, but the scales of justice are blind to our personal
prejudices.</p>

<p lingdex="21">But, let’s assume you’re right. I have to wonder what took so long
for us to come along and put all the other life forms to use. Life
has been around hundreds of millions of years, and we’re only a few
million years old. What a waste. We never did get to use the
dinosaurs—oh, wait, didn’t they get turned into oil and coal? I
guess we could be using them.</p>

<p lingdex="22">OK, I’ve give you that one, too. But, if all other life is here
for us to use, is it responsible of us to eliminate it? How can we
use it if it’s gone? If VHEMT is successful—or if our extinction
comes about naturally—the issue of future generations’ welfare
will be moot, but if humanity continues to exist, how can we play God
and dictate to future humans which species stays and which goes?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="23">&gt;Animals don’t have the slightest clue that they’re going to die
someday, and when they do, they don’t even realize it. THEY won’t be
missed. If all the tigers died out, the only species to actually MISS
them would be us.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="24">It seems to me that modern society as a whole doesn’t miss much of
what we’ve already destroyed. We have the capability of missing them,
but if we really did, we wouldn’t be eliminating them from the web of
life forever.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="25">&gt;Someone needs to assasinate you before you go fucking
nuts...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="26">Hey! Some of my best friends are nuts... but seriously,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="27">&gt;... (if you haven’t allready) with this psychotic plan of
yours.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="28">I’m not in a good position to say if a plan to voluntarily stop
breeding for the good of all life is psychotic or not... I’m
involved, right? How would I know? All I can do is look at the
situation, and be as rational and compassionate as I’m able.</p>

<p lingdex="29">It looks to me like we are speeding toward the massive die off
which all species experience after their numbers increase beyond
their environment’s capacity to sustain them. We know full well where
we are going, but instead of slowing down and turning around, we
continue on our path to oblivion—taking much of Earth’s biosphere
with us. Now, really, which plan is psychotic?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="30">&gt;Humans were put here for a reason, for a species doesn’t evolve
and succeed out of the clear blue.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="31">I don’t know if we were put here or evolved here, but I agree we
might have a reason and a purpose. Is it possible that our evolution
to a higher level would prompt us to voluntarily become extinct so
that other life might live? Altruism seems to me a higher level of
consciousness than selfishness. Would you agree?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="32">&gt;Who do you think you are dictating what species stays and what
goes, huh? Fucking God or something?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="33">Right on! Glad we agree about the obscenely arrogant attitude
humanity is taking with regard to extinctions of non-human life.
Maybe we are, in a sense, “fucking God” and I’ll bet She’s getting
damn tired of it, too.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="34">&gt;You &amp; your followers either need to die a swift death, or get
locked up in some mental institute,&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="35">We will all be dead soon enough, don’t rush us... or yourself.
When we wish ill of our fellow beings, we are wishing ourselves ill
as well. Is what I’m advocating really that much of a threat to your
well being? Just inhale our industrial strength air and you’ll
consume more “evil shit” than I’ll ever write.</p>

<p lingdex="36">This may seem nit-picking, but there are no followers in The
Movement. We’re all leaders—leading the way to a better life for
all.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="37">&gt;...you mad fucking scientist. DIE!&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="38">Okay, but until then I intend to live, evolve, and do the best I’m
able. I wish the same for you.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="39">&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&amp;
lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&amp;
lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="40">&lt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &lt; &gt;</p>

<p lingdex="44">That doesn’t have anything to do with Satan, does it? A Volunteer
was concerned about that when I forwarded your message.</p>

<p lingdex="45">[Later, another Volunteer pointed out that I really am a “mad
fucking scientist.” Since procreative sex is insane today, one could
call it “mad fucking” and I am scientifically studying it.]</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="46">From Steve,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="47">&gt;AFTER I STUMBLED UPON YOUR WEB PAGE...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="48">Sorry about that. I keep meaning to put up a warning sign:
“Dangerous web page ahead. Don’t be trippin’.” I hope you’re okay,
’cuz my liability insurance lapsed</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="49">&gt;I GAVE IT A CHANCE, READ YOU POSTION AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL. YES
YOU DO MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS, BUT WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS
THAT LIKE IT OR NOT WE (HUMANS) ARE ANIMALS, AND AS SUCH WE ARE PART
OF NATURE, AS OPPOSED TO AGAINST IT.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="50">But what if we have evolved to the point of being exotic invaders?
Starlings and kudzu are a part of Nature too. Maybe in some quaint,
philosophic way, we are still a part of Nature too, but really, what
part of our lives are involved with the natural world? Nearly all the
plants and animals we come in contact with are domesticated,
including each other.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="51">&gt;I’VE GONE TIMES IN MY LIFE WHEN I’VE ASKED, LIKE MANY PEOPLE, WHAT
IS THE POINT TO BEING ON EARTH, WHY ARE WE HERE, THE ONLY LOGICAL
CONCLUSION IS TO KEEP THE SPECIES GOING, TO REPRODUCE.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="52">Golly, some people fulfill their entire reason for being before
they’re even old enough to vote. Hmmm, since I got fixed and can’t
breed, does that mean I have no reason to live? Yer breakin’ my
heart.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="53">&gt;YES HUMANS ARE GREEDY, VIOLENT, AND MANY OTHER NOT SO NICE
QUALITIES, BUT THAT IS A RESULT OF OUR MORE ADVANCED BRAINS, THAT IS
OUR ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER ANIMALS IS OUR BRAINS.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="54">I sure hope dogs’ brains don’t ever get advanced like ours.
Imagine if they became greedy, violent, and stuff. Not only would
they chase cars, they’d drive ’em, too.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="55">&gt;JUST LIKE THE HAWK IS ABLE TO FLY, WHICH GIVES IT AN ADVANTAGE
OVER THE FIELD MOUSE IT EATS, OUR BRAIN GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE OVER
ALL OTHER ANIMALS.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="56">Yeah, I see what you mean. Those poor dumb critters just eat,
excrete, and have fun. We have our careers, our powerful machines,
and our art.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="57">&gt;THE LARGER MORE ADVANCED BRAIN ALSO HAS IT’S DOWNSIDE, WHICH ARE
IN PART THE ABOVE MENTIONED QUALITIES, BUT WITH EVERY GOOD THERE MUST
BE A BAD....&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="58">However, good and bad are human distinctions. We can twist bad to
look good, especially when another’s loss is our gain. A new strip
mall is good for us and bad for the wetlands it replaced: oh well,
gotta have the bad with the good.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="59">&gt;NOW I DO AGREE THAT THE PLANET TO AN EXTENT IS IN DANGER, AND I THINK THAT WE HUMANS WILL EVENTUALLY KILL OURSELVES OFF. BUT TO THINK
THAT WE SHOULD VOLUNTARILY TRY TO ERADICATE THE SPECIES IS AGAINST
NATURE, FOR WHAT OTHER POINT IS THERE TO BEING IN THIS PLAIN OF EXSISTENCE.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="60">I just can’t imagine our purpose being to breed and kill ourselves
off like ignorant yeast in a batch of beer. THAT sounds against
Nature—maybe not against HUMAN nature, but that’s why I’m
promoting the hopeful option of a peaceful phase out of our
species.</p>

<p lingdex="61">Yes, we have the big brains to realize that our kind is driving
itself into oblivion, taking a bunch of other life with us. Now, do
we continue to accelerate in that direction, assuring ourselves not
to worry ‘cuz we’ll stop as soon as we slam into the wall? Or do we
slow down, stop, and turn around instead?</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="62">From anonymous,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="63">&gt;Man i think you are sooo fucking mentally gone fucking shit dead brain...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="64">I think I see what you’re getting at here. You object to my
stating that the continued existence of humanity can’t be
justified.</p>

<p lingdex="65">It’s natural for us to become angry when facing a new and
threatening concept. But, really, do you think there’s any reason we
should continue to breed? Having sex is one thing, creating more of
ourselves is something else entirely.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="66">&gt;...what the fuck is your problem...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="67">Good question. Thanks for asking. I think my problem is your
problem. It’s also the problem facing all life on Earth: our species
is destroying the biosphere in which we live.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="68">&gt;...are you like brain dead you acid peace of shit...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="69">Sometimes I do feel like brain dead, so I understand your
perspective. Perhaps it’s all the toxins in our air, water, and food.
Do you feel it too? Exhaust fumes cause people to go into rages
without provocation. We sometimes direct anger wherever we can get
away with it because the true sources of our frustrations are too
powerful.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="70">&gt;...man you suck so bad;&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="71">Sorry, this does not compute.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="72">&gt;... respond if you want to argue about your point of view&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="73">I’m responding out of respect for your right to a reply from me, however, I don’t argue.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="74">&gt;... btw you are fucking loco pendejo y puta madre cabron eres un
pendejo&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="75">Maybe we’re all pendejos, but at the same time we’re all human
beings, deserving the respect all life deserves. Unfortunately, most
of us don’t get that respect, and as a result, we often disrespect
others.</p>

<p lingdex="76">Do you think there’s any justification for continuing a society
which produces citizens who think it’s alright to personally insult
fellow family members and their mothers just because they disagree
with their views?</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="77">From William,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="78">&gt;If your group is so intent on volutary human extinction, then may
I suggest your members start by removing themselves from the planet
first.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="79">Yes, you certainly may do that. In fact, I’ve been working on
removing myself since I was born. Each day I’m closer to being gone.
It won’t take that long, really. And when I’m dead and gone, there
won’t be another of me to continue taking habitat away from wildlife,
nor to experience continued deterioration of Earth’s life support
systems.</p>

<p lingdex="80">My bequest to Earth’s biosphere may not be huge, considering that
there are 5.8 billion of us.</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="81">From Marion,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="82">&gt;You are right about the many reasons for Earth’s unfortunate
non-human species. Human overpopulation is the key to Earth’s major
ecological dysfunctons. Lost species, endangered species, and
potential species loss are now, and will be, determined by the
population of humans that exist on Earth. Yet, you’re effort to
‘demonize’ humans for punishing and hurting the local flora and fauna
are irrevelant to the ultimate problem of habitat loss.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="83">I’ll have to re-read the VHEMT web site. I certainly don’t
consider humanity to be evil any more than exotics like starlings are
evil. If I sounded like I was demonizing our species, sorry about the
misunderstanding. We have evolved into an exotic invader which is
incompatible with Earth’s biosphere, but it is our human qualities of
rationality and compassion which are the basis for voluntary human
extinction. If we were evil, there wouldn’t be much hope for a
voluntary phase out.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="84">&gt;Humans are here to stay.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="85">I’m not so sure. We seem to engineering our demise as our numbers
exceed the carrying capacity of our environment and as we eliminate
more and more of our life support system.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="86">&gt;I believe that if an animal or plant has something of value to humans, it will eventually become endangered, or extinct. But,
habitat loss is the ulimate destroyer of a species. Your painful
reference to how animals are treated in captivaty are irrevelant to
your initial arguement of overpopulation.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="87">Yes, habitat loss is the main cause of extinctions, except for the
many endangered species which are poached for asian
pseudo-pharmaceuticals. Either way, human activities are the cause.
Captivity and exploitation of domesticated animals may be irrelevant
to certain other arguments, but this point seems irrelevant to the
discussion as a whole. As we phase ourselves out, other domesticated
animals will also be phased out</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="88">&gt;Therefore, I believe you to be a part of the same irresponsible
dogma issued by so many ‘Greenpeace’ type radicals of the past.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="89">It’s difficult to respond to the above statement without knowing
what you imagine the irresponsible dogma issued by so many
“Greenpeace” type radicals of the past to be. It’s tempting, when
faced with an idea we aren’t familiar with, to bunch it in with
something we do understand. The VHEMT philosophy is really quite
simple: we voluntarily stop reproducing, the human race dies out, and
what’s left of Earth’s biosphere has a chance to recover. If other
dogma agrees, so be it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="90">&gt;You offer nothing new...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="91">Perhaps VHEMT is nothing new. I can imagine that millions of
people throughout history have realized that Homo sapiens is too
great a threat to all other life and should be phased out. Even the
Middle Eastern god of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism lamented that
he had created man, and decided to flush the planet. He missed one
family and now look. Whether VHEMT is new or old seems immaterial to
its validity.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="92">&gt;... and you believe more in a sense of morality that will justify
your existence (therefore satisfying your psyche) than the future of
humanity.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="93">Thanks for telling me what you think I believe and why, however, I
think you are somewhat mistaken. True, a sense of morality permeates
the concept of voluntary human extinction, but practical concerns are
also important. As for justifying my existence, I don’t consider that
possible nor necessary. The only future of humanity I’m concerned
about is between now and our extinction. We can continue on our
present course to involuntary extinction, taking much of Earth’s
biosphere with us, or we can choose to peacefully and responsibly
phase ourselves out voluntarily.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="94">&gt;You’re desire of human elimination is noble, I sense. Do you
offer to be the last human being who would ensure that our species
was eliminated and would never again infringe on any other species of
the planet?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="95">I’m far too old to be the last human on Earth.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="96">&gt;You are the REAL cancer!&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="97">I’m only human, human.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="98">&gt;Perhaps you should choose to eliminate yourself? Could you choose to be elimintated in the name of Mother Earth?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="99">I already have. I’ll be dead soon enough without rushing things.
Since I’ve chosen to not breed, I’m a terminal bud on my family
tree.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="100">&gt;......a true irony, indeed. World overpopulation is an obvious threat to humans and other organisms, but you should always remember,
it is HUMANS that will suffer ultimately.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="101">Which is one more very good reason to not sentence another of us
to life.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="102">&gt;To believe in GAIA and the belief that how we treat animals
determines our morality is somewhat rediculous. Remember, we are
animals.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="103">Don’t you think that how we treat each other determines our
morality? Are you saying that morality has nothing to do with our
treatment of other life forms?</p>

<p lingdex="104">Regarding the Gaia hypothesis, I don’t believe in believing or
disbelieving—it’s unscientific. The hypothesis that Earth itself
is a life form helps us to see things in a new perspective. It’s not
impossible.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="105">&gt;A definition of animal includes a sort of ’survival of the
fittest’.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="106">One might be tempted here to state that this is the same
irresponsible dogma issued by so many “Darwin” type radicals of the
past. But that does nothing to clarify our points of view.</p>

<p lingdex="107">It seems to me that survival of the fittest has become a
justification of irresponsibility rather than a basic premise of
evolutionary theory. Bison couldn’t adapt to increased lead in the
air, so they deserved to go extinct. (Present bison are a different
sub-species from the one which covered the prairies before our
manifest destiny collided with theirs).</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="108">&gt;Funny, I value you more than a fern in Australia.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="109">We do have to make choices such as this. I kill slugs in my garden
so that other life forms can live. Just the other day I found one
sucking the life out of an earthworm. In my garden, I value worms
more than slugs.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="110">&gt;Lastly, under your guise it would be wrong to kill ants, mice, scorpions, roaches, black widows, silverfish, mistletoe, and flue
virus.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="111">Most of the above don’t need to be killed for us to survive, but
this illustrates the way humans create a zone of death around our
habitats. Actually, it’s the extinction of species that’s my main
concern—killing individual creatures which aren’t threatened may
or may not be wrong, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="112">&gt;I have more but will capitulate. I am a follower of Paul
McCartney and other believers of Eco ‘realism’.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="113">I’ve never heard of that. Is there a web site I can go to?
Eco-realism sounds like exactly what VHEMT is all about.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="114">&gt;Also, I am a Life Science teacher who is always looking for new ideas....&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="115">Cool. You’re welcome to use VHEMT when you study animal populations, especially overshoot and die off: “There’s even this nut group that believes...”</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="116">From JRD and/or TDD,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="117">&gt;Please begin the journey to human extinction by taking the first step yourself with suicide and go to hell.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="118">Actually, the first step is to stop creating more of us, we’ll all
be dead soon enough—many of us too soon. Like the 40,000 children
who die on an average day from a lack of care. And people STILL won’t
stop making more. How do you suppose any couple could morally justify
that?</p>

<p lingdex="119">I’ve decided to commit suicide by old age. It takes longer, and
can be painful, but there’s just too much work to do for me to leave
now. That would be irresponsible.</p>

<p lingdex="120">When I’m successful in my suicide I don’t think I’ll follow your
advice. Sorry. It just doesn’t sound like a place I’d like to be
caught dead in.</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="121">Hello Joe,</p>

<p lingdex="122">Thank you for writing and sharing your interesting views on
voluntary human extinction, our chances for success, and life in
general. You might be as amazed as I am by how many people don’t
bother to type out a few words to let me know what they think about
the VHEMT concept. I appreciate your input, and also the opportunity
to clarify some finer points about The Voluntary Human Extinction
Movement.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="123">&gt;This VHEMT thing is just sad. I mean really.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="124">I have to agree, it’s really sad that we are so incompatible with
Earth’s biosphere. It could have turned out different, but it
didn’t.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="125">&gt;I have seen dumb things in my life, but this really takes the
cake.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="126">Yeah, looks dumb to me, too. It’s easy to see when someone else is
sawing off the limb they are standing on. The hard part is realizing
when we are the ones sawing off the limb we stand on—like
the human race is doing to our life support systems right now.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="127">&gt;Guess what, you moron. No one cares if humans eliminate 99.9
percent of the species on this planet.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="128">That 99.9 percent of the species on this planet is the limb we are
standing on. Just ‘cuz no one cares won’t change what happens when it
goes.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="129">&gt;We will save the ones we want and need, keeping all of the
necessary species to continue life as we know it on this planet.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="130">This is a major reason why we Homo sapiens have an obligation to
phase ourselves out. Everywhere we live, only a few “necessary”
species are allowed to survive. Being human, I do it too. There are
mice eating next year’s lawn seed in my garage, and they won’t
survive much longer. Nothing personal, I just don’t want mice in my
house, nor rattlesnakes. I let black widows live, they keep to
themselves.</p>

<p lingdex="131">So I know exactly what you mean. This is what we do with life on
Earth. We’ve domesticated the animals and plants we can use, and are
eliminating the rest, rather quickly, too. More species are going
extinct now that at any time since the dinosaurs’ demise.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="132">&gt;I sincerely hope you get to see that you misguided fool. Won’t
that be fun for you?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="133">I’m living to see it right now, and it doesn’t exactly tickle my
fancy.</p>

<p lingdex="134">You’re probably right about my being somewhat misguided and
foolish. The odds of convincing six billion people to stop breeding
aren’t good. But what else can I do? What would you do if you saw
your neighbor standing on a limb high in a tree over your patio roof,
hacking away on the part between him and the trunk? Ask him to stop?
It’s his tree, his limb, and none of your business unless it falls on
you—which it will, but you can’t prove that, he says.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="135">&gt;A nice human-run world?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="136">The world is certainly human-influenced in every aspect. However,
it’s beginning to look like it’s the world that has us on the run. A
billion of our kind will have to move to higher ground when sea
levels raise one meter, according to some radical scientist I heard
on the radio. Melting ice, y’know. The nine hottest years on record
were in the past 11, or something like that.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="137">&gt;Or even better, when we inevitably spread to other planets? Will that make your little tree-hugger heart break too?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="138">I’m not worried about us spreading to other planets. We can fantasize about building a space ship out of the limb we’re standing there sawing off, but circumstances will prevent it from becoming a reality.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="139">&gt;You know, the dumbest thing about your little movement, is that you will die in one generation.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="140">I know it seems like people who advocate not breeding will just
die out, but a VHEMT awareness isn’t something we inherit. All of us
were born from those who bred, and yet we’ve decided to not breed
more than we already have. Millions of people are accessing the
internet where VHEMT web site is viewable. Tens of thousands are
reading the message, and who knows how many thousands are realizing
that the best thing for Earth, and for ourselves, is a voluntary
phase out of our species.</p>

<p lingdex="141">The Movement may seem small at first glance, but there are two
different bumper stickers for sale, and in a while we might have some
T-shirts too. A quarter of a million potential VHEMT Volunteers are
born every day, so you could say The Movement is getting bigger by
leaps and bounds.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="142">&gt;The rest of the human race will laugh, and then forget you.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="143">I’d love to give the world a laugh, and teach it birth control.
And if they forget me, that’s okay: The Movement will live on until
we die out.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="144">&gt;Sorry.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="145">Hey, don’t apologize. We’re only human.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="146">&gt;My advice is this. Since you can have no net impact on human
society, you should sell everything you own and go live in the
rainforest for as long as it is still standing. Then you can be ‘one
with nature’.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="147">Yeah, that’s tempting. The “fight or flight” reaction to danger
sometimes makes us head for the hills instead of trying to make
things better where we are. The biggest problem with moving to the
rainforest is that humans can’t be one with nature any more. Not us
domesticated versions, anyway. What I would probably do is keep the
species I need and kill the rest in as big a radius as I could
achieve, just as our kind has done for ten or twelve thousand years
at least.</p>

<p lingdex="148">I’m afraid you might be right about that “no net impact on human
society” idea. We would have to be gaining a quarter million new
Volunteers each day just to keep even with population growth.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="149">&gt;And we can forget about you.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="150">You can try. Denial has its costs, though. Deep down we know we
can’t kill off 99 percent of life and still survive. Our collective
arrogance has to be constantly reinforced to hide the truth from
ourselves.</p>

<p lingdex="151">Another possibility is for us to accept the situation for what it
is, and to use our compassion and reason to do what should be done,
or to stop doing what should not be done, as the case may be. May we
live long and die out.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="156">&gt;You are an idiot.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="157">I’m only human, but enough about me. Your generous offer intrigues me.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="158">&gt;You know, I agree with the extinction of people like yourself and
your represented group. And I would be willing to give money to aid
you in your cessation of breeding. I think it would be a great
service to our world and way of life to have people like you dwindle
away and phase out. If I can help you with this, please let me
know.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="159">Why, yes, many of us could use some help in phasing ourselves out.
A vasectomy costs at least $250 and many of us have no insurance.
Some of us have insurance through an HMO, but often it’s owned by the
Catholic Church, and they won’t help us prevent abortions due to some
strange encyclical that can only be understood in Latin, or
something.</p>

<p lingdex="160">If you would like to send your contribution directly to the
Planned Parenthood clinic which will be performing the procedure(s)—thus removing our genes from the pool forever—just let me know
and I’ll send the address. If you would like to choose who receives
your assistance, I’ll send a list of code names and a brief statement
from each explaining why they want to get fixed.</p>

<p lingdex="161">Thank you for your heartfelt humanitarian efforts. We need more

<p lingdex="184">Aw shucks, you’re just saying that.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="185">&gt;Greenism fading to black!&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="186">You noticed that too. Defoliation, desertification, scraping and
paving—the green is fading to black. Why do you suppose that is?
Could the 220,000 per day increase in our population have anything to
do with it?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="187">&gt;Are you sure you are not a VRWC satire of the left?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="188">Gee, I don’t know, maybe so. Does VRWC stand for Very Right Wing
Conservative? I can’t say what VHEMT is not without knowing what that
means.</p>

<p lingdex="189">At any rate, although there may be some satire in what I’ve posted
at the website, the purpose of The Movement as a whole is not to
satirize the left—whatever the Left is these days. VHEMT aspires
to help others achieve a greater awareness of humanity’s place in
Earth’s biosphere.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="190">&gt;(And by the way, if humans shouldn’t breed, then why should ants? Or elephants? Luvit!)&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="191">Well, let’s see. Ants in Africa do build high-rise apartment
buildings, same as we do. I think the difference is that they fit
into their ecosystem and don’t cause the extinctions of other
species. Also, those tall ant hills are far more efficient than ours.
They have solar heating and cooling without wires running to a
polluting power plant.</p>

<p lingdex="192">Elephant populations have exceeded their artificially-constrained
habitat, and some restriction on their breeding has been suggested.
Slaughtering entire herds with bullets has been the practice, but you
know how animal rights activists get upset by that sort of thing.</p>

<p lingdex="193">Seems like humans often use similar methods of retroactive birth
control. Rwanda is one of the more resent examples. I think you and I
might agree that there are better ways of thinning the herd than mass murder.</p>

<p lingdex="194">From Fender,</p>
		
<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="195">&gt;You shouldn’t waste space on the internet with crap like that.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="196">As I understand it, there’s tons of space on the internet. The VHEMT site is pretty small, with no fancy graphics. Did you notice how fast it downloaded? </p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="197">&gt;Human Extinction is just stupid,...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="198">So it might seem at first glance. However, I think if you look at
it objectively you’ll find that it makes sense. We are causing tens
of thousands of species to go extinct each year, and if anything is
stupid, that is. Seems to me it’s only fair that we voluntarily phase
ourselves out to avoid causing the extinction of millions of
non-human life forms.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="199">&gt;... anyone who follows you is stupid,...&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="200">I agree. Following others is stupid. The Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement has no followers—we are all leaders, leading
humanity toward a hopeful future for all life on Earth.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="201">&gt;... and you are stupid.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="202">Hey, I’m only human, human.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="203">&gt;I have one request. Send me a blueprint of your brain because I am building an idiot and you seem like the perfect prototype.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="204">I recommend that you rethink your frankensteinian project due to the lack of demand. It seems the market is already flooded and reproduction hasn’t slacked off yet.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="205">&gt;Here’s a suggestion, if you really want to see the human race
extinct I think you should start off by killing yourself. I’m sure no
one will miss you.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="206">I’ll be dead soon enough, don’t rush me. And when I’m gone it
won’t matter to Earth’s biosphere if other humans miss me or not.
When Homo sapiens becomes extinct, I’m sure none of the remaining
animals will miss us.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="207">&gt;Anyway, I’m gonna stop writing now. My Mom says I shouldn’t pick on retards and you seem to be one of them so I’m just gonna say goodbye Nimrod....&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="208">You might have me confused with someone else: my name is Les, not
Nimrod. I think I’d change my name if it were Nimrod. Isn’t that the
bracket that holds a fender on a car?</p>

<p lingdex="209">Anyway, your mom gives good advice—I agree that we shouldn’t
make fun of those we feel superior to. They need our understanding,
not our ridicule.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="210">&gt;... and I hope you die soon and make the world a better
place.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="211">But, if I die tomorrow, someone else would host the VHEMT web
site. The Movement has a life of its own. I’m just one of the current
promoters of the concept. Millions of good people around the planet
have independently arrived at the awareness that Earth will be better
off without us.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="212">&gt;Save The Planet--Kill Yourself Jerk Off.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="213">I will consider your advice, but it seems to me you have things a
little turned around. Like, how can I “jerk off” after I’m dead?</p>

<p lingdex="214">I agree with you that masturbation, and other non-procreative
sexual activity, will go a long way toward saving the planet.
Auto-erotic stimulation has many benefits to society and to the
person engaging in it: relief of sexual frustration has been known to
reduce anti-social behavior such as insulting fellow members of the
human family.</p>

<p lingdex="215">The following were received and replied to after January 1, 2001</p>

<p lingdex="216">From Anonymous,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="217">&gt;Don’t you think it is perhaps slightly
arrogant to believe that humans are so large of force that we are
capable of destroying the entire planet or all life on
it?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="218">Maybe we aren’t capable of turning Earth into another Mars, even
if we made it our goal and expended all our energies doing so.</p>

<p lingdex="219">But, y’know, it seems to me that’s exactly what we ARE doing.
Whether we succeed in ending all life, or simply reduce life to
insects and below, I think our rampant destruction is indefensable.
Just because we might not be powerful enough to totally destroy the
planet, doesn’t mean it’s alright to partially destroy it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="220">&gt;The earth has withstood asteroid
collisions the magnitude of which can’t be imagined and every time
the earth has rebounded with all it’s previous glory.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="221">Yes, 65 million years later, Earth was replenished; without the
dinosaurs.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="222">&gt;After the humans have had there time at
the top of things the earth will rebuild itself in a diverse
way.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="223">Yes, tens of millions of years from the time our greed destroys
most of the web of life, a whole new biosphere will probably exist on
Earth; without the Homo sapiens.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="224">&gt;Humans have lived for such a miniscule
amount of time in comparison to the existance of life on the planet
that to think humans are to much for the planet is misguided.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="225">In the few million years we’ve been here, we have, as you noted,
emerged as the most powerful species. In fact, this has happened just
in the last 10,000 years. Our ability to alter massive amounts of
Earth’s surface has only existed a short time. Nuclear weapons aren’t
much older than I am. Nonetheless, in spite of these minuscule
amounts of time these changes have occurred in, they seem to be too
much for large portions of the planet.</p>

<p lingdex="226">Can we morally justify destroying life forms which have taken
billions of years to evolve? Sure, others will come along to take
their places, but that seems like saying it’s alright to kill someone
because 389,000 more are born on an average day.</p>

<p lingdex="227">I don’t think we have the right to cause even one species to involuntarily go extinct. This is a paradox, however, since the crab louse and a couple dozen other species, will become extinct when we do. A tragic loss.</p>

[The crab louse may jump species and live on. We have at least <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2011/mar/04-trillions-microbes-call-us-home-help-keep-healthy/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C=">1,000</a> different species living in and on us, so more than a couple dozen are likely to go extinct when we do.]
<hr>

<p lingdex="228">From Yoshi,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="229">&gt;You know what? You have a very twisted
and warped view of reality.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="230">I realize the concept of our phasing ourselves out may seem warped
and twisted at first glance. It’s not what most people think yet.
Thank you for taking the time to consider it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="231">&gt;The human species exists only as a blip
in the BIG picture.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="232">True, we’ve only been around for the blink of an eye compared with
the entire existence of life on Earth. We do work fast. Although we
are only a blip, our activities will influence life on Earth until
there’s no life on Earth. This may seem like an inflated view of Homo
sapiens, however, when we consider that tens of thousands of species,
which have evolved at the expense of billions of other species, are
being eliminated from the web of life each year, it’s apparent that
we are profoundly affecting the big picture.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="233">&gt;As a human you also have a rather
inflated view of yourself and the human race.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="234">It’s a funny thing: we are the most important species and the
least important at the same time. The choices we make have the
greatest impact on Earth’s biosphere, so we could be considered the
most important species. On the other hand, the higher up the food
chain a species is, the less critical to the web of life it is. Our
extinction will have far less impact than that of, say, the common
krill would.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="235">&gt;There is no need for a global solution.
The human species will be its own doom or salvation.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="236">Yes, that’s the idea behind VHEMT: we are either the doom or the
salvation. We can continue as we are and suffer the consequences,
taking much of non-human life with us, or we can use our reason and
compassion to make changes which bring about our “salvation”.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="237">&gt;I believe that the human population will
either balance itself or die out completly. Right now we are going
through exponential growth. With normal biological systems, after
expoential growth comes a population crash.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="238">Again we agree. The massive die off which follows overshoot of
carrying capacity is well understood. We might be the only species
capable of foreseeing the die off in time to avoid it. Now it’s just
a matter of whether we will or not.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="239">&gt;TO preserve the earth Human attitude
must change as well.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="240">Yes, quite true. It’s not enough for us to all stop breeding. If
not one more human were ever born, and we don’t improve our
relationship with the natural world, there won’t be much left by the
time we’re all gone. As the ecological disasters of the past show, we
don’t need six billion to cause massive damage.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="241">&gt;All human life on Earth does not need to
be erased just changed.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="242">You’re not alone in this belief. Many VHEMT Supporters don’t feel
that the human race should go extinct, just that the intentional
creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can’t be justified at
this time.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="243">&gt;Your genocidal solution amuses me, and
also saddens me to think that some humans have become so jaded that
they can see no solution but mass death.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="244">Me too. I regularly hear from people who say that we don’t have to
worry about excessive human population because Gaia will wipe us out
if we get to be too many. To me this is like saying we don’t need to
step on the brake because the car will stop when it hits the
embankment anyway. Why do we have brains, and brakes, if we don’t use
them?</p>

<p lingdex="245">It’s indeed saddening to think that some are so jaded, or have
lost so much hope, that they see the massive death we are engineering
for ourselves as inevitable. VHEMT Volunteers may not be able to
convince enough people to stop breeding in time to avoid the crash,
but many of us feel a moral duty to try.</p>

<p lingdex="246">VHEMT is not about death, it is about life. Although we all must
pass on eventually to bring about our extinction, shortening our
lives will not help. For death to keep our population at the level it
is today, an additional 220,000 people would have to die each day.
This is not a viable solution for many reasons, morality number one.
The motto of VHEMT is “May we live long and die out.”</p>

<p lingdex="247">Helping couples gain the freedom to prevent the conception of new
humans is a far more positive approach.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="248">&gt;Oh and by the way... No species on this
planet is without a place in the intricate web of life. Our
extinction would be no less disasterous than any other so don’t kid
your self... every action has a reaction. remember
that&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="249">Thanks for the reminder. Something to keep in mind when balancing
the extinction of one species—Homo sapiens—with the number of
other species going extinct because of our existence.</p>

<p lingdex="250">There may be a couple dozen species which live only on or in
humans, and they too will tragically cease to exist. This is the
trade off: preserve the web of life as a whole by removing the
species which is removing all the other strands in the web.</p>

sidetrack we have. Many species, not just apes, exhibit intelligence
on a par with us—even though we try to skew the scale of
intelligence to make it seem like we’re the smartest. None of them
seem to be in line to convert the rest of the world into their
habitat as we are doing.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="269">&gt;3) Modern humans have been around for
about 100,000 years. Civilisation as we know it has only been around
about 10,000 years. It took us 90,000 years of wandering around
hunter-gathering to come up with the idea.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="270">Or perhaps they didn’t have to come up with it for the majority of
our existence. Hunting and gathering in warm climates takes much less
work than farming and ranching. When our population got too dense to
support us in the old ways, we had to build shelters, defend the
stored food and so on. This meant we needed more people to work the
fields, tend the herds, and fight the wars. Then we needed more land
for farms and flocks. Our civilizations are based on pyramid
schemes.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="271">4) During the last 10,000 years, we have
suffered many technological setbacks and lost
civilisations.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="272">And excessive breeding is often the cause, though the blame gets
shifted to droughts or mini-ice ages as in 535 CE. Cultures become
more fragile as they become more dependent on artificial systems for
life support. Native Americans in the Southwest increased in number
thanks to their success with domesticating corn. Then a severe and
recurring dry period, which had not destroyed their civilizations
previously, resulted in their migration and virtual abandonment of
their cities. There are many examples, and we may be creating yet
another, on a greater scale than ever before.</p>

<p lingdex="273">Our technology has postponed the dieoff which all species
experience after they go into overshoot of their environment’s
carrying capacity. This will make the dieoff all the more horrific
when it finally occurs. We could avoid this, or at least avoid
sentencing someone to life only to die in it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="274">&gt;I find it unlikely that the earth will
once again spawn an intelligent species with as good a chance as us
of developing interstellar travel.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="275">Before we seek out new worlds and go where no human has gone
before, it seems to me we have an obligation to clean up our messes
on this world.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="276">&gt;So I think that we should not become
voluntarily extinct. That would condemn life on earth to a very
probable firery end. When, very probably, we are a mere 200 hundred
years away from averting that catostropy.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="277">It sure seems to me that we are a mere 200 years away from
creating catastrophe approaching that scale.</p>

<p lingdex="280">Thank you. The subject needs a little levity to offset the
gravity.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="281">&gt;Personally I think humun extinction is
not only way too extreme, but just plain wrong. A significant
reduction to a stable and sustainable world population of (say) 1
billion seems a lot more consistent with your objectives than total
extinction,&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="282">You’re not alone in thinking this. VHEMT Supporters, as distinct
from Volunteers, are not in favor of our extinction. Generally,
Supporters agree that the intentional creation of one more of us by
anyone anywhere can’t be justified today, but maybe when our density
is improved enough to be sustainable, we can rethink our
breeding.</p>

<p lingdex="283">In order for us to improve our population density to what it was
almost 200 years ago, as you suggest, a virtual moratorium on
breeding would be necessary. I certainly favor any improvement in our
density. The most favorable projection I’ve seen is for our numbers
to peak around 2050 at 10 to 12 billion. My feeling is that Earth
can’t sustain that many people, but perhaps if we convert most of the
remaining wildlife habitat to our uses, we could do so for a short
time. I say short time because a major ecological collapse would
surely follow.</p>

<p lingdex="284">Once we got down to whatever Earth can support, the tricky part
would be to keep our numbers down to that point. It was only 10 or 12
thousand years ago our density was low enough to be sustainable.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="285">&gt;allowing harmony with nature while
developing important but intangible concepts such as poetry, justice
and art.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="286">Those things only have value to humanity. We have evolved into a
virtual exotic invader in Earth’s biosphere as a whole. Now that we
no longer live in mutual benefit with Nature, our existence is not
compatible with natural ecosystems. When an exotic species is
introduced to an ecosystem, extinctions can and do occur. The fossil
record shows that each time Homo sapiens arrived on a new continent,
a major spasm of extinctions occurred. We don’t know why yet:
probably diseases, hunting, or a combination of the two plus
something we are over looking. We continue with new methods and are
bringing about the sixth great spasm of extinctions.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="287">&gt;Humans do add value, through the
appearance of consciousness, and this great power needs to be
managed, but surely not extinguished.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="288">Consciousness may be what set Homos erectus, neandertalus, and
sapiens apart from our ancient ancestors, and from other animals as
well. Some say it was learning how to use fire, others say
agriculture was the beginning of the end. Consciousness seems like a
good thing for us at this time, but does it benefit Earth’s biosphere
as a whole?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="289">&gt;I assume you’ve heard of Deep Ecology,
the bio-centric as opposed to human centric philosophy first properly
expounded by Arne Naess?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="290">Naturally, which is why I asked the question just above. Actually,
I think many other animals demonstrate some degree of
consciousness.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="291">&gt;Anyway, thanks again for your site and
thoughts. It helps confirm my commitment to having only .5 of a
child.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="292">Congratulations on your personal sacrifice. If everyone limited
their procreation to one half of an offspring, just think how fast
our density would improve.</p>

<p lingdex="293">I heard Paul Ehrlich speak and he was advocating a global average
birth rate of 1.5. He also said that the only way we could feed 10
billion people would be if we all stopped eating meat and implemented
an equitable food distribution. Those two things aren’t going to
happen, but then no matter what he suggests doesn’t mean it will
happen—same as with VHEMT.</p>

<p lingdex="294">It seems to me his suggestion would guarantee hundreds of millions
of deaths from starvation, but if he said one child he would be
linked to China’s policy, and if he suggested 0.5 he would sound like
a nut—even though that’s a rational suggestion.</p>

<p lingdex="316">LATER:</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="317">I didn’t really intend to start a discussion
about the subject, but finally have gotten some time to try to
respond.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="318">For starters I guess I would have to say
that you and I are coming from totally different perspectives. I
happen to believe that God created the world and that man was his
ultimate creation. People were meant to be stewards of all that is on
the earth. I will grant you that we have done a poor job, and I
certainly approve of birth control to limit the number of children to
that which parents can reasonably support. However, this problem is
relatively new. The advances of the last century or so - especially
in science and medicine -have caused a huge increase in the
population. Even though thousands die of starvation and disease, the
toll is not what it was for many centuries. Unfortunately man’s
inventions are far ahead of his ability to monitor their use and the
morality that must be employed in that endeavor. Scientists discover
and invent things - they care not about the morality or consequences
of their inventions. It is up to others to decide what can and should
be used and how. For centuries this problem did not exist. In a
relatively short time many things have come about and we have yet to
come to terms with their effects. I haven’t given up yet on man’s
ability to solve some of the problems that these tremendous advances
have caused. Starvation is not caused by lack of production - The
problem is poor distribution caused by economic and political
problems. I think human beings should have a little more time to try
to solve the problems before they throw in the towel and decide that
the only solution is to commit suicide and totally annihilate the
human race. I assume that you are not a Christian - your ideas are
totally against the teachings of most of the major religions,
including Christianity. As a Christian, I believe in the second
coming and divine intervention. It is not my right to decide that
human life should cease to exist any more than it is my right to
decide that we should eliminate all the fish or all the animals.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="319">Anyway, your article was interesting reading, but I think the chances of you winning over much of the population is zip to nil, so I won’t worry about it. </p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="322">&gt;Les, I enjoyed your website. However, I am very skeptical that we as humans have the power to utterly destroy the Earth.&lt;</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="324">&gt;I’m sure with some massive effort, we
could destroy much of life as we know it, but in the grand scheme of
things, what would it matter?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="325">This seems to be the feeling of most people. Actually life as we

happens in between?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="326">&gt;How much time do I have on this planet? About 80 years? What good is any of this stuff if i’m not around to enjoy it?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="327">Good point. Since we won’t be around to enjoy what’s left of
Earth’s natural ecosystems, we may as well die out and let other
animals enjoy it. Not many of us enjoy Nature anyway: the vast
majority would rather watch TV than a living forest. I feel certain
that if we really did enjoy other life we wouldn’t be destroying
it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="328">&gt;Also, I find that much of the
environmental movement greatly exaggerates how detrimental we are to
the planet. People like Paul Ehrlich get on the news making dire
predictions about global warming and ozone depletion destroying our
lives by the year 2000 and very little of it has come to pass.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="329">Yeah, some people thought the human body would fly apart when we
reached the speed of sound. Others thought we would figure out what
to do with nuclear waste before it became a problem. Some predictions
were wrong, that doesn’t make all of them wrong. Maybe some of the
warnings helped prevent the disasters from occurring. It remains to
be seem if ozone depletion is destroying our lives or not. Incidence
of skin cancer has increased.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="330">&gt;Perhaps you remember him writing how in
the 90’s people would have to wear gas masks simply to go outdoors
and no-one would open a window other than to commit suicide. My
favorite was in grade school during the late 80’s when my leftist
sixth grade teacher encouraged us all to stop using aerosol
hairspray, when aerosol hasn’t been used in hairspray since
before I was born.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="331">No, I don’t remember those predictions. However, there are oxygen
booths in cities where air pollution is particularly bad. I sometimes
use a respirator when stuck in traffic. No, you don’t need one to
survive, but that stuff accumulates. It’s even worse when I’m on my
bike, but I need more air than the respirator will deliver.</p>

<p lingdex="332">I’m not sure about the propellants in hair spray and paint these
days, but that’s another of those “100 simple things you can do to
save the planet.” Things like, take shorter showers and turn out the
lights so there’ll be enough for your neighbor’s 18 offspring.
Conservation is important, but if we use half as much and double in
number we will have accomplished nothing.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="333">&gt;My guess is we’re a lot less destructive
than environmental&nbsp;extremists claim and more destructive then
people like Rush Limbaugh claim.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="334">With such high stakes, seems to me we should err on the side of
caution.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="335">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, all this is
immaterial. My question is, do you honestly think the majority of
people will ever convert to your way of thinking?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="336">It hasn’t exactly caught on as I’d hoped. Convincing six billion
people to stop breeding does seem like a rather daunting task. Most
of them don’t even speak English, though the VHEMT site is also in
Italian. The odds may be against voluntary human extinction, but
there’s too much at stake to just give up and let humanity take its
course.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="337">&gt;I must say, altruism really isn’t
that great of an incentive for me not to reproduce.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="338">Thanks for your honesty—most folks won’t admit it. There are
many non-altruistic reasons to not procreate, and all the reasons
I’ve heard for doing so are self-centered. This wouldn’t matter if
our reproductive choices today didn’t have so great an impact on
society and wildlife habitat. We all have to live somewhere, and that
makes less habitat for other species.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="339">&gt;Perhaps if you offered some sort of cash prize.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="340">Cash saved by not reproducing constitutes a huge prize.
Unfortunately, in the USA, a cash prize is offered for those who
breed: $500 per year, per child. One presidential candidate wants to
double that. Meanwhile, many men can’t afford the cost of a
vasectomy.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="341">&gt;Why should I feel any guilt for
putting my survival above the survival of other animals?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="342">You don’t have to put your survival above other animals: voluntary
human extinction is a win-win solution. All we are asking is that
people stop breeding—this doesn’t interfere with personal
survival. In fact, more than a few parents have found that producing
offspring seriously interfered with their survival.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="343">&gt;Animals show no such mercy to each other, why should I?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="344">Other animals may not show mercy when they kill something and eat
it, but at least they don’t make a sport out of it. They don’t kill
every last one, either. Estimates of extinctions today have a wide
range, partly because we don’t know how many species there are on
Earth. There may be as few as 10 million or over 100 million, though
only 1.5 to 1.8 million have been cataloged. The figure of 27,000
extinctions per year has been accepted by the National Wildlife
Federation as close enough, though some biologists say it’s
understated. Mercy, mercy.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="345">&gt;What led you to this movement?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="346">Love and logic.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="444">&gt;In fact, altruism for other species by

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="449">&gt;In not-so-rare occasions that one
species has had such power, they have used it to the extreme.
How ’bout cyanobacteria that released toxix amounts of oxygen into

RUINED the wonderful barren aestheticism that our planet
once claimed. We still haven’t been nearly that
destructive.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="450">Yes, but cyanobacteria didn’t know any better, we do. In terms of
the percent of life eliminated, that bacteria was worse than us,

than at that time.</p>

<p lingdex="451">A mass murder like Stalin, Mao, or Kissenger might say that

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="452">&gt;Or beavers, which cause entire
ecosystems to go out of wack with thier incessant dams.&nbsp; They
weren’t about to let themselves&nbsp;go extinct so that the myriad of
small rodents and trees in their area could live on.&nbsp; That why
we humans did it for them.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="453">I know it seems like beaver cause damage, but in reality they are
a keystone species in their ecosystems. Natural mountain meadows will
never recover fully from our nearly complete elimination of them, but
with beaver returning, those ecosystems are improving. Those dams are
essential for preventing excessive erosion in the Spring snow
melts.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="454">&gt;What’s my point? You can’t stop

<p lingdex="455">Do you call pulling strands from the web of life “progress”?</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="458">&gt;Humans will no doubt change the

<p lingdex="459">I fear you’re right about this. As in the days of the Black

with. We may have passed the point of no return toward a major
ecological collapse. Not that we should give up and let humanity run
its course—there’s too much at stake.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="460">&gt;We may go out and “ruin” other planets
as primordial life did to ours.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="461">Don’t worry, the space program is only for military purposes—those scientific expeditions are to give it legitimacy: blast a
teacher into space to show it’s in the name of education. Our greed
and lust for power will keep us focused on Earth. Energy beams might
one day also be focused on Earth with the help of GPS, eliminating
crime and rebellion.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="462">&gt;Honestly, I see greedy-eyed
humans&nbsp;as a hoard of ants invading an abandoned bread
factory. But there is a beauty to nature, (and therefore
the human race) that nothing else can match. Nature made
sunsets, orcas, rainforests, and waterfalls. Don’t forget that
Nature can also claim the mona lisa, the pantheon, the parthenon, and
the Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate Highway System.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="463">That’s an interesting comparison. If some wacko slashed the Mona

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="466">&gt;I like your site,&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="467">Thanks for the encouragement.</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="468">From Rod,</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="469">&gt;I get from your site that you think that
nature, or “Gaia”, as you call it, is to be the authority by which
all questions are to be answered.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="470">Well, not really. Gaia is a name many use for Earth’s biosphere,
so I’ve used it once or twice at the VHEMT website. I wish it didn’t
trigger so many assumptions because I get tired of typing out
“Earth’s biosphere” and would rather simply type “Gaia”. The term
“Nature” doesn’t include as much excess baggage, unless it’s
capitalized.</p>

<p lingdex="471">You’re not far off in saying that I think Earth’s biosphere is the
authority by which all questions are answered. Our survival depends
on Nature’s well being, which would be reason enough to stop
destroying pieces of it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="472">&gt;Therefore, I assume that you take nature
to be an infallible intelligent force. (If nature was not infallible,
would we consider it worth consulting?)&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="473">There are those who believe that Gaia is a single life form, and
I’ll accept that—in a metaphorical sense at least. Some think Gaia
thinks, and others worship it, or Her, as a god. To each their own, I
say. Anything is possible—except maybe infallibility.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="474">&gt;I also assume that you believe that man
evolved as a part of nature. (Otherwise, you have to assume another
force that can overpower “our” nature. What would that be?)&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="475">Who knows? A petrie dish in some mad scientist’s lab? Most likely
we evolved as a part of Nature, and have evolved into a virtual
exotic invader to the very environment which allowed our
creation.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="476">&gt;If nature is infallible, and man evolved
as a part of nature, then you must conclude that mankind and whatever
mankind does is exactly what nature wants, and your angst about what
you see as the destruction of nature is misplaced. If what you see as
being the correct natural world is being destroyed, then given the
above it can only be because nature doesn’t need such a world
anymore, because now nature has man.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="477">By golly, you might be right. Gaia was asking for it. She created
the reality that lead to her rape. She should have known better. She
has a death wish. It’s not our fault.</p>

<p lingdex="478">Seriously though, This concept of infallibility doesn’t apply to
Gaia. The Pope can claim it if he needs to. Some try to justify even
the most evil deeds by saying that, since it happened, it must have
been fated to be. I think you and I can see through that ploy.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="479">&gt;Did Mt. St. Helens feel remorse about
the thousands of trees and critters it destroyed?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="480">They say humans are the only species which can feel remorse, or to
has reason to. Well, maybe they don’t say that, but let’s just
pretend they did, who’s gonna know?</p>

<p lingdex="481">What happened when Mt. Saint Helens blew probably didn’t bring
about the extinction of any species. It’s a cycle in the long term
existence of healthy volcanic ecosystems.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="482">&gt;Your standpoint seems to me to say,
“nature is too good to allow man to destroy it, but too weak to
defend itself, and too stupid to know what it is doing”.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="483">I can see how it might seem like that’s what I’m saying. Yes,
Nature is too good—too precious and rare—for me to not protest
its destruction. No, Nature is not too weak to defend itself. One of
the blessings of voluntary human exctinction would be avoidance of
the massive die off which always follows a species’ over shoot of its
carrying capacity.</p>

<p lingdex="484">Since voluntary human extinction doesn’t look too likely at this
point, a die off may not be avoided. This is why the intentional
creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can’t be justified.
It’s the moral equivalent of renting rooms in a burning building—renting to our children, no less.</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="485">From Renata:</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="486">&gt;Well, I know one should not respond to a
question with a question, but why is it desirable to return the earth
to its former glory, to paraphrase your movement?&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="487">Your question gets at the root motivation for VHEMT, so it’s a
good place to start. Sometimes we forget that the foundation of an
idea might not be obvious to others. Maybe I should add an
explanation to the web site.</p>

<p lingdex="488">I can’t speak for all VHEMT Volunteers, but it seems to me we have
a moral obligation to undo the damage we’ve done to Earth’s natural
environment. Many people today habitually foul their nests and then
move on. It’s a modern version of the slash and burn system which was
viable for as long as Nature could restore an area before people came
back around to the same place. Today, people pay cleaning deposits
for the privilege of leaving a mess behind, but our civilization as a
whole isn’t held accountable. I’m sure you don’t need a list of where
we’ve converted ecosystems into lifeless zones. If one sees nothing
wrong with this, then the VHEMT plan to restore Earth’s biosphere
probably won’t make sense.</p>

<p lingdex="489">Even if one sees nothing wrong with destroying other species and
their habitat, it might help to remember that humanity depends on the
web of life to survive. We can’t continue to remove strands from the
web and expect to avoid a disastrous fall.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="490">&gt;Other than your person preference, there
is no reason. I think a lot of people have children for the wrong
reasons. On the other hand, not having children for voluntary human
extinction would be a wrong reason not to have
children.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="491">I’m still looking for that good reason to create a new human. In
light of conditions for planet and people today, I don’t see how the
intentional creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can be
justified.</p>

<p lingdex="492">As far as mitigating the environmental impact of our species goes,
it doesn’t matter why someone refrains from further procreation: each
person not created saves a lifetime of consumption and production of
toxic waste.</p>

<hr>

<p lingdex="493">From Knorr:</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="494">&gt;If we were to limit ourselves to one
child, the human population would contract over time.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="495">The key term is “over time”. Population growth has a momentum
which is hard to describe. China’s one-child policy has lowered birth
rates dramatically, but the population is still growing. One way to
look at it is, if one couple has 10 off-spring, the increase is 10.
If each of them has only one, the increase is still 10, although the
birth-rate has dropped to one tenth of the previous rate.</p>

<p lingdex="496">There are several reasons why advocating a one child average won’t
do the job:</p>

<p lingdex="497">1) I question whether we have the time to wait for population to
peak and begin to shrink. Ecological conditions are becoming worse as
more strands are removed from the web of life.</p>

<p lingdex="498">2) Which brings us to another reason: the world we would be
sentencing a loved one to life in isn’t all that great. The future
isn’t what it used to be. I think intentional procreation today is
the moral equivalent of selling berths on a sinking ship.</p>

<p lingdex="499">3) Each new human we bring into the world, especially in North
America, will have a detrimental effect on the natural world:
wildlife habitat destruction, resource extraction, and production of
toxic waste.</p>

<p lingdex="500">4) To say it’s okay to create even one more of us is to say that
things aren’t really so bad. Well, they are.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="501">&gt;technology takes what seems to be it’s
logical course now, we could have fusion power in the future, which
really would be a panacea.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="502">The problem is that all energy converts to heat eventually, and
heat, as we are finding out the hard way, is a pollutant. A cold
fusion process for generating energy could reduce the environmental
impact of our industries, but it could also allow manipulations of
Earth’s biosphere on an even grander scale—depending on whether we
arrive at a higher level of awareness before we get it or after. The
industrial revolution was fueled by coal, which polluted the air, but
if a “non-polluting” energy source had been used, the impact of that
revolution would only be slightly mitigated.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="503">&gt;We might actually be able to have a
population of a few hundred million and very minimal negative impact
on earth.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="504">A smaller population would certainly help. However, when we were
hunting and gathering at the close of the last ice age, we may have
pushed a few fragile species into extinction. In ancient times, our
numbers were smaller, but we managed to convert the Fertile Crescent
and the Cedars of Lebanon into deserts. The Sahara and the Gobi may
have been caused by ancient civilizations. We don’t need to be as
numerous or possess “advanced technology” to destroy huge
ecosystems.</p>

<p lingdex="505">Also, as long as there is one breeding couple around, there’s the
danger of us increasing to where we are now in 20,000 years.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="506">&gt;Let’s look at it from another
perspective: We decide to go extinct. You know very well this could
never happen voluntarily, but for the sake of argument, let’s say we
go extinct.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="507">Australopithecus Africanus lived 2 million years ago. Let’s say that from existing primates, it takes a pessimistic million years to get another a. africanus, a human ancestor. So we’re 3 million years from another sapient species. What will they do? Exactly what we have done.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="508">Studies of the Great Apes indicate that they are as intelligent as
Homo sapiens. They just don’t interact with their environments as we
do. We alter environments to suit our greeds while they alter their
activities to suit their needs. Primitive peoples behaved similarly,
but were only a plow away from beginning to change everything.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="509">&gt;Every organism’s primary motivation is
survival and they will exploit their environment just as readily as
we have - and fail to develop a conscience for it until they have
advanced in their technology quite far, just as we
have.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="510">We can’t tell if it’s a lack of consciousness that prevents, say,
whales from altering their environments. Perhaps it’s just the
opposite. Have we developed a level of consciousness adequate for
humanely managing our level of technology? We can’t even get land
mines outlawed. Weapons of mass destruction have been ruled illegal
by international courts, and yet nukes abound. We’re getting there,
and I hope we continue making progress as we phase out.</p>

<p lingdex="511">The difference will be, they will have far less fossil fuel to work with. They’ll be stuck with the plentifully available coal. Oil will very likely be scarce. It will
take longer for them to advance in technology to where we are now. It
would take them longer to reach the theoretical panacea that allows
us to stop worrying - fusion or some similar deux ex machina.</p>

<p lingdex="512">Vast civilizations of ancient times didn’t need coal, oil, or
radiation. It’s only when we become so dense that we need massive
energy sources.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="513">&gt;So what’s the difference? Evolution
marches on, and if it’s not us, it will be some other species that
exploits the Earth. That conclusion doesn’t please me, but as far as
I can tell it follows the logic you exhort me to use on your site....
Tell me why I should expect that another sapient species won’t come
along in another 3 million years, even though it’s already happened
once.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="514">It’s true that another species could become the next tool-wielding
ape after we die out. There’s no way of knowing, nor of preventing it
in advance. However, I don’t think this justifies our continued
existence. Many evil deeds are done with the excuse that someone else
will do it if we don’t do it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="515">&gt;I really would enjoy a discourse on this
if you have time. I really, honestly believe deeply in the cause that
you are working for, contraction of the human population, and I’d
like you to talk me out of my position.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="516">You are probably right about it being unlikely that humans will
voluntarily phase ourselves out. What we have to work on is
awareness. By stating that humans should become extinct, maybe people
will realize how drastic it is to bring about the extinction of
27,000 non-human species per year. By saying that the intentional
creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can’t be justified,
perhaps people will reconsider the impact of their redundant
breeding.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="528">&gt;The ideas promoted at your VHEMT website
are without doubt entertaining and though provoking, but also flawed,
both logically and philosophically.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="529">Thanks. Provoking thought is the main idea. I’d much rather
someone thoughtfully disagreed than mindlessly agreed with the VHEMT
concept.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="530">&gt;Let’s start with the logical: No one has
even come close to proving that A) The number of species on this
planet is decreasing&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="531">The fact that species are going extinct at a rate unknown in 65
Million years is well established. The conservative National Wildlife
Federation estimates that 27,000 species go extinct each year due to
human activity.</p>

<p lingdex="532">If you chose to ignore the data and believe that this hasn’t been
proved, then VHEMT is not actually faulty logic—it’s sound logic
based on faulty data.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="533">&gt;or B) That even if the number of species
on this planet is decreasing it is because of us humans&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="534">Even if the scientific community didn’t agree on this, I think
it’s obvious when we look around that wildlife habitat has largely
been converted to human habitat. Without habitat, species die
off.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="535">&gt;and C) Even if the number of species is
decreasing and even if it is because of us humans that it would stop
if we would no longer be there.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="536">On this we agree. Even if not one more human were to be born, we
could still continue to destroy ecosystems. By the time all of us
died out there wouldn’t be much left of the natural world—unless
we change our orientation from human-centered to Earth-centered. As
the ecological disasters of the past show, we don’t need six billion
to cause massive damage.</p>

<p lingdex="537">[I misread Maurice’s point “C&amp;“. He is correct that extinctions
would continue after we are gone. “Spiralling extinctions“ or a
“domino effect” will continue diminishing biodiversity for hundreds
of years, even after we have stopped causing them. Eventually, the
rate will return to the normal background rate, with sudden spasms
due to natural Earth events and extraterrestrial influences.]</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="538">&gt;All we can say is that the planet’s
eco-system is changing, but to merely react to this change with fear
and loathing is a kind of eco-conservatism than can be thrown on the
same heap as religious, sexual and racial conservatism.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="539">What good are our brains if we don’t use them to figure out what’s
right and wrong? If we can’t use them to see that the planet’s
eco-system is being changed by us, we are shirking our
responsibility. When atmospheric temperatures raise due to our
industrialization and cause drastic weather changes, can we reject a
reaction of fear and loathing simply because it’s too conservative?
Of course it’s conservative: we’re trying to conserve and preserve
what’s left of Nature.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="540">&gt;Whether change is good or bad is all in
the eye of the beholder. To think that it is bad that some ’higher
order’ species are becoming extinct is a very human-centric point of
view. The point of view that only values that what is like us.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="541">I agree. When people only care about fuzzy creatures going
extinct, it’s rather human-centered. Most pitches for saving wildlife
include something like, “For our children’s sake.” Not for the
lifeforms’ sake. The VHEMT plan seeks to avoid the extinction of
millions of life forms, not just cute frogs.</p>

<p lingdex="542">Public relations firms hired by resource extraction companies use
the reasoning that “Whether change is good or bad is all in the eye
of the beholder.” They might say, “We are enhancing the forests by
making them accessible to more families to enjoy.” They claim a
“partnership with Nature.” Sure, it’s a one-sided partnership, but
who’s to say a monoculture tree farm is not as “good” as an ancient
forest ecosystem? Those 2,000 year old redwoods Maxxam is liquidating
will grow back in time. It’s all in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="543">&gt;That brings us to the philosophical
argument against VHEMT. For centuries humans have though of themselfs
as the pinnacle of creation living on a planet at the center of the
universe. At least some of us realize nowadays that this is not true.
We are merely one of a number of practically indistinghuisable
liveforms on a remote planet in a remote galaxy.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="544">Each species alive today could be considered the pinnacle of its
evolutionary development. But I think there are distinctions between
life forms which we must make. If the slugs in my garden were
indistinguishable from humans, I would be a mass murderer this
morning.</p>

<p lingdex="545">Using a balance scale, like Justice holds in her hand, place all
the species going extinct on one side and Homo sapiens on the other.
Survival of Earth’s biosphere depends on biodiversity; on a wide
variety of species. Even if we are 100 times more important; or 100
thousand times more important; the scales tips in favor of the other
species.</p>

<p lingdex="546">Actually, we are far less critical to the web of life than, for
example, the microscopic bacteria in the intestines of termites. The
higher up the food chain a species, the more expendable it is. It’s a
tragedy that most mammalian carnivores are going extinct, but the web
of life can continue without them. Now our toxic chemicals are
affecting more critical strands on the web; some of which we don’t
even realize exist.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="547">&gt;Earth is like a scummy pebble on the
beach of the universe and nothing would care whether one type of scum
kills the other or whether a wave comes to wash it all away. The only
thing that cares about live on our planet is us humans! Do you think
a blue whale cares about the extinction of the bald eagle? Of course
not. Humans are the only species we know capable of actually caring
about other species, as VHEMT clearly demonstrates.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="548">Yes, VHEMT is the embodiment of our capacity to care about other
species than our own. I have to note, however, that the VHEMT concept
hasn’t exactly caught on.</p>

<p lingdex="549">Other living beings can be excused from not caring about each
other—humanity has no excuse for callous disregard of life we
can’t utilize.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="550">&gt;If humans had existed would we have
tried to save the dinosaurs? Yes! Who will save the world from other
disasters but us? Get rid of humans and you might as well get rid of
everything else, because who would care. In fact without humans all
that would be left is a bunch of utterly selfish liveforms that do
not give one ounce about one another.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="551">Do we really try to save other species? Some of us won’t even
acknowledge the fact that they are going extinct, or that our
activities are causing it. We can’t save the world from disasters
while pretending the disasters are from the gods.</p>

<p lingdex="554">As it turns out, I had almost finished my reply when time caught
up with me.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="555">&gt;You keep referring to VHEMT as a

<p lingdex="556">There are no members, no organization, and I have no plans to list

the same conclusion.</p>

<p lingdex="557">However, a new section at the VHEMT website titled, “<a href="http://vhemt.org/agreements.htm">Agreements</a>” should fill the information void you have pointed out—when I get the revision completed.</p>

<p lingdex="558">On 15 Jun 2000 you wrote:</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="559">&gt;Your ideas are shared by a handful of naive, hormone-ravaged kids looking for a cause, not millions of people.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="560">We’re all entitled to our opinions, however, when I apply the
number of favorable messages I receive to the general population, I
figure we constitute 0.05% of humanity: about three million. This
includes those who aren’t in favor of our extinction, but who realize
that the intentional creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere
can’t be justified at this time.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="561">&gt;Hyperbolic, self-agrandizing statements
such as this merely confirm my categorization of you as a “kook.” I’m
not using that term just to be dismissive, you really fit the bill.
For a good discussion of what a kook is, read the book “High
Weirdness by Mail.”&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="562">Yes, that’s a fun book too, though I prefer Donna Kossy’s
definition and her distinction between kooks and cranks. As a great
American once said, “I am not a crank.” At any rate, back to the
concept of voluntary human extinction.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="563">&gt;I am an ardent environmentalist who
strongly believes in wise stewardship of the planet. I’m an almost
rabid supporter of biodiversity. However, I am not an unthinking
romantic or a misguided misanthrope like you.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="564">I think the notion that humanity could someday achieve the level
of awareness and compassion to phase ourselves out for the sake of
all other life is indeed a romantic one. If I were a misanthrope I
wouldn’t be bothering with voluntary methods.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="565">&gt;In fact, I am scientist (Ph. D., serious
publications, faculty position-all the usual credentials). My
environmental views are close to those of E. O. Wilson or Peter Raven
(also scientists).&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="566">That’s great—then you might get the opportunity to talk with
E.O. Wilson in person at a conference. He doesn’t dare say publicly
what he really feels about Homo sapiens sapiens and our effects on
Earth’s biosphere: he’d be called a kook. I’d like to ask him how
likely it is that we have already passed the point of no return
toward a major ecological collapse. By this I mean 50% or more of
Earth’s 10 to 100 million species go extinct—all higher order
species, including us, gone.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="567">&gt;The real world of real organisms is a
Darwinian/Jack London type of world where nature is “red in tooth and
claw.” Lives are full of fear and they are nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="568">Whew! Glad we’re not like that. Well, except for the 40,000
children who die from a lack of care on an average day. Oh, and those
in refugee camps, and in war zones, and areas devastated by
human-enhanced natural disasters or toxic waste. Also excluding the
one to two billion of us who are undernourished. Maybe we should
include in this exclusion the billion of us who are malnourished
because we have so much to eat, too. At least we can have rewarding
lives in our safe little cubicles.</p>

<p lingdex="569">Actually, it seems to me that wildlife doesn’t live in fear as we
do. Their fight or flight mechanisms activate and then shut down when
the danger passes. Our dangers never pass because we know too much.
We know we’re going to die, and some of us worry about that. I doubt
any other species does. They don’t stress over mortgage payments
either, though their habitat may be more at risk than ours.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="570">&gt;The deer would love to have the wolf
self-exterminate and the mouse the owl.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="571">They wouldn’t if they understood the balance of populations. Where
the wolf has been eliminated, deer have not fared well.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="572">&gt;The case you present could be used to
argue that the dinosaurs should have self-exterminated because they
dominated the planet and other species suffered. Or, get this, maybe
bacteria should self-destruct. Their biomass is far greater than
ours, many bacteria cause pain to other organisms,
etc.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="573">The argument in favor of our extinction isn’t that we cause pain
and suffering, it’s that we are eliminating other species. Sorry I
didn’t make that clear. Although we do torture animals in “research,”
and kill them for sport, our biggest crime is causing the extinction
of, what’s the latest ballpark figure? 27,000 per year? If you have
another one I’ll accept that. Pulling strands from the web of life
while increasing our demands on it will lead to a major ecological
collapse. I know you have this information, so please don’t feel I’m
being pedantic. I’m just trying to clarify why so many of us feel we
should stop breeding, for now at least.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="574">&gt;As far as we know, we are the only
intelligent life to ever evolve in the entire universe. This makes us
rare and precious.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="575">I detect a conflict of interest in our judging this contest for
intelligence.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="576">&gt;If you think that is something that
should be exterminated you are one vicious, nihilistic
bastard.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="577">Nah, nah, takes one to know one. Seriously though, as someone who
understands the dynamic symbiosis of ecosystems, why do you pick
“intelligence” as such an important aspect? There are other criteria
we could choose in determining relative degrees of rare and precious.
The Bengal tiger is far more rare than Homo sapiens. Keystone species
are more precious in that entire ecosystems are disrupted when they
disappear. Would our exit leave an empty niche in any biological
system?</p>

<p lingdex="578">How great are we? 100 times greater than the next greatest? 1,000
times? How about we give ourselves a 100,000 times advantage over any
other species on Earth? We are wiping out indigenous species at a
rate unknown since the dinosaurs’ demise 65 million years ago. If you
use the balance scale like blind Justice holds, place us on one side,
and all the species going extinct on the other, the sales will tip in
favor of our extinction, even with our weighted advantage.</p>

<p lingdex="579">Drew writes:</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="580">&gt;I think that a more humanitarian view
would be that of humans being a part of the ecosystem. Obviously if
we can leave such large impacts on the envirnment we too must
represent a portion.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="581">Perhaps this is a matter of how we define “being a part of”
Earth’s biosphere. We could be a part of nature in the same way that
a timber company is a part of the forest. We could be a part of
nature in the same way a farmer is part of the farm. We could be part
of nature the same way, say, an otter is: eating sea urchins and
being eaten by sharks.</p>

<p lingdex="582">In my opinion, we were once like the otter, part of the ecosystem.
Then we started farming and now we’ve become like exotic invaders, no
longer part of nature, though we depend on it and impact it.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="583">&gt;The idea of systematically destroying
the entire human race is bogus.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="584">I fully agree. This destruction and involuntary extinction we are
headed for is far worse that just bogus. Rather, I think we have the
rational ability to stop our race toward oblivion. We also have the
compassion to do what is necessary to preserve the rest of Earth’s
biosphere.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="585">&gt;Look at it this way<br>
1. If humans evolved, then we are obviously
part of the ecosystem. or....<br>
2. If humans were created by a divine being (as I balieve) then it is humans that have the right to govern the enviornment as we please. The human race should then do everything
that we can to help the environment.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="586">Why not both? Couldn’t a divine being use 3.5 billion years of
evolution to create the life forms which exist today?</p>

<p lingdex="587">I don’t see how it follows that, since we were created by God, we
can do what we want with all of God’s other creations. “Having
dominion over” certainly doesn’t mean driving to extinction.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="588">&gt; If humans learn how to help other life
forms we can actually make the world a better place for them and help
them increase their numbers.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="589">Helping other life forms has become a necessity, but only because
of our existence. If we had just left things alone, they would be
fine. No one knows how many species are going extinct due our
activities, but the conservative National Wildlife Federation
estimates 27,000 per year are disappearing forever. I don’t think we
can arrogantly hold that God wants us to do this.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="590">&gt;I feel that what you represent is
quiting and that humans are sporadic generating beings.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="591">Actually, I think continuing along our present path constitutes
quitting. But, there are some bad habits we should quit.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="592">&gt;Where do you believe that humans came
from??&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="593">Since our genetic make-up is so close to other primates, I think
we probably originated on Earth. We’re so different, it makes one
wonder if we’re from another planet.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="594">&gt;I feel that humans are divine beings
that are not disposable. Your idea is that of blsphemy, playing
God.&lt;</p>

<p lingdex="595">It seems to me that claiming humans are divine beings is playing
God. Altering God’s creation to suit our greeds really seems
blasphemous if anything is.</p>

<p lingdex="596">Perhaps, as you say, we are not disposable. If there is an
afterlife, this temporal existence is not the end. Moving on to other
realms could be part of God’s plan as the apostle Paul wrote in II
Corinthians 5:1-6.</p>

what makes Humanity so dangerous in the first place. &lt;</p>

<p lingdex="613">You’re not alone in thinking this. VHEMT Supporters, as distinct
from Volunteers, are not in favor of our extinction. Generally,
Supporters agree that the intentional creation of one more of us by
anyone anywhere can’t be justified today, but maybe when our density
is improved enough to be sustainable, we can rethink our
breeding.</p>

<p lingdex="614">Perhaps by considering our own extinction, some may more fully
appreciate what the extinction of other species means. The big
thicket hog-nosed skunk and Steller’s sea cow may be difficult for us
to identify with, but then so are some people’s in-laws.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="615">&gt; There is no need to destroy this race,

<p lingdex="616">If management would suffice. The tricky part would be to keep our
numbers down to that point. It was only 10 or 12 thousand years ago
our density was low enough to be sustainable. Even then, each time
Homo sapiens entered a new continent, extinctions followed. It may
have been our diseases as much as our hunting, but whatever we did,
it wasn’t good for the regional ecosystems. We continue with new
methods and are bringing about the sixth great spasm of
extinctions.</p>

<p style="color:#c33" lingdex="617">&gt;Before you get any ideas about me

<p lingdex="639">The following explanation is under the chart:<br>
“This excludes any global catastrophe or climatic change as an explanation.”</p>

<p lingdex="640">In all of these cases except Africa, the extinctions occurred
shortly after the first arrival of prehistoric humans. The first
