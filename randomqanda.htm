<h2>Random questions from VHEMT website visitors<br>					
and answers from Les U. Knight.</h2>
</div>

<p lingdex="0"><font color="#CC3333">“I am unclear as to how one can propose to
be a humanitarian and also advocate the extinction of the human race.
”</font></p>

<p lingdex="1">At first glance, this does seem to be a contradiction. If,
however, one considers the fact that we are breeding ourselves into a
probable die off, the VHEMT alternative is clearly the humanitarian
approach.</p>

<p lingdex="2">We may already be entering the die off stage, with 40,000 children
dying each day from preventable causes. If the parents of these
children had the freedom to choose not to conceive, most of them
wouldn’t have been sentenced to a short, tragic life and painful
death. Reproductive freedom is a major first step toward voluntary
human extinction.</p>

<p lingdex="3"><font color="#CC3333">“I read through your stuff and I realize
that you are an intelligent person and not just some internet
crackpot so this is surprising. Why should I care about the
environment and animal concerns over human needs and
wants?”</font></p>

<p lingdex="4">My perspective is more Earth-centered, so the answer to this
question is obvious to me. However, even with a human-centered
perspective, we should care about other life because, whether we
realize it or not, we are dependent on them for our survival. By
reducing biodiversity as we are doing, we are sawing off the limb we
stand on.</p>

<p lingdex="5"><font color="#CC3333">“If you truly care about helping to end
suffering, then do something useful. Of course you must be well aware
of the countless ways that exist to alleviate suffering within the
world and more specifically within your community. Many organization
exist to try to help people, (and the environment, and animals). I
realize that not much progress has been made.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="6">When we choose to cease breeding, we have more time to engage in
noble activities such as helping others. As long as our needy numbers
continue growing by 210,000 per day, we won’t make much progress. If
we are able to improve birth rates and turn things around, there’ll
be more of everything for everyone. More habitat for wildlife as
well.</p>

<p lingdex="7"><font color="#CC3333">“It is staggering and depressing to think
about how much suffering goes on in the world while we live in
relative comfort. I’m am not an ethical egoist. I don’t believe that
a person should only be concerned with his or her own needs. However
there is a limit to the help we can give.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="8">True. And sometimes helping others is as much about what we don’t
do as do do. By not creating another mega-consumer in North America,
we are avoiding the exploitation of workers in poorer regions, among
other things.</p>

<p lingdex="9"><font color="#CC3333">“One thing I have learned is that one’s own
life is important and you shouldn’t sacrifice it for anything. Live
your own life to its fullest and try to help others if you
can.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="10">I agree. VHEMT is a cause to live for not to die for. Rather than
sacrificing one’s life, it could be dedicated to whatever worthy
efforts one chooses.</p>

<p lingdex="11"><font color="#CC3333">“In light of all these unsolvable world
problems we feel helpless, but is the answer to them human
extinction? No. That is a give up method; a cop out.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="12">Well, I realize it looks like it, but on the contrary, I think
giving up would be to continue in the direction we are headed.</p>

<p lingdex="13"><font color="#CC3333">“I would rather try to help my fellow human
beings and this planet regardless of how futile it is. I would rather
fight than propose an impossible plan that would not help anything
anyway. As you said humans are definitely the most powerful animal.
We have the ability to help to some degree and I believe in
trying.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="14">Choosing to phase ourselves out is only one important aspect of
the plan to stop killing Earth’s biosphere. We also have much to do
on our way out: cleaning up our toxic messes, dismantling dams,
restoring ecosystems, and so on.</p>

<p lingdex="15">Our choices have the greatest influence on Earth’s biosphere, so
we could be considered the most important species. On the other hand,
the web of life can do quite nicely without us. It that sense, we are
the least important species. The microscopic bacteria in the
intestines of termites are far more important to the survival of life
on Earth than humans are.</p>

<p lingdex="16">I share your commitment to keep on trying. Convincing six billion
people to stop breeding is unlikely, but I think it’s our best hope
for averting the ecological collapse we are precipitating. Each new
human who is not created may be counted as a double success: they
won’t be sentenced to live through the coming difficult times, and
times might not be as difficult without them.</p>

<p lingdex="17"><font color="#CC3333">“While I am sympathetic to your ideas about
preserving the environment, I am afraid that I cannot agree with your
solution. The main problem with your argument is that your problem
and your solution are diametrically opposed to one
another.</font></p>

<p lingdex="18"><font color="#CC3333">“You are arguing that human beings should be
extinct because they are too terrible to exist on this planet. You
then advocate that human beings choose to make themselves extinct in
what must ultimately be a unanimous decision of
self-sacrifice...”</font></p>

<p lingdex="19">Yes, this is paradoxical. VHEMT is based on the love and logic
which humanity is capable of using. And yet, if we actually used it,
maybe we wouldn’t have to go extinct in order to preserve non-human
life. Some have said that, because we have compassion and rationality
and fail to use it, we are worse than the “lower” animals. I prefer
to not be so negative about humanity.</p>

<p lingdex="20"><font color="#CC3333">“The problem is that if people were to ever
be so “noble” as to do this, there would be no real problem in the
first place. Further more, by removing yourselves from the gene pool
at this time, you are in fact ensuring the further development of
those who’s views are opposed to your own. Hence, humanity will not
become extinct, but your ideas will.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="21">Fortunately, ideas aren’t inherited gentically. We can influence
others and don’t have to breed new recepticals for the VHEMT concept.
Actually, it’s as much an awareness as an idea. Millions of people
are independently arriving at the conclusion that Earth’s biosphere
will be better off without Homo sapiens.</p>

<p lingdex="22"><font color="#CC3333">“So, you seem like a reasonably intelligent person. Why don't you devote your time to a realistically worthy issue. Maybe political reform, so governments do more than pay lip service to environmental preservation.”</font>
</p>

<p lingdex="23">You're right about the need for political reform so that governments will protect the environment as most people want. It's as if large corporations have more say about what governments do than the people have. Challenging the demands of corporations with billions of dollars at their disposal may not be much more realistic than encouraging everyone to stop breeding, but both are worthwhile activities nonetheless. </p>

<p lingdex="24">Simply ceasing to breed does more than pay lip service to environmental preservation. </p>

<p lingdex="25"><font color="#CC3333">“I do not write this in criticism of your
movement (although I do not agree with it in the least), but rather
ask that you seek another solution to this problem. If this effort
were put towards encouraging environmental responsibility, we could
in fact look for a way to have all enjoy this world.”</font></p>

<p lingdex="26">Phasing ourselves out is only a part of the solution. As you say,
we also need to encourage environmental responsibility. It’s
difficult to tread lightly with 12 billion feet. Every environmental
plan simply holds back the inevitable as long as we continue to
increase our population density.</p>

<p lingdex="27">I too want all to enjoy this world. Existing life, human and
non-human alike, deserves a life free from exploitation, fear, and
want. The catch is that Earth’s biosphere can’t support the number of
people already existing, let alone the 80 million a year being
added.</p>
		
<p lingdex="28">The idea of humanity phasing itself out may seem difficult to
accept at first. Many people consider themselves VHEMT Supporters:
they don’t want Homo sapiens or any other species to go extinct, but
they realize that the intentional creation of one more of us by
anyone anywhere can’t be justified at this time.</p>
