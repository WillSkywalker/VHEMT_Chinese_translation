Convencido de que la raza humana es nociva para la Tierra, Les Knight solicitó a los 25años que le practicaran la vasectomía. Hoy vive en Portland, Oregon, donde fundó el Movimiento por Extinción Humana Voluntaria (VHEMT por sus siglas en inglés). Él y susadeptos son "vehementes" por la pasión con la que defienden su postura: "Vive una largavida y desaparece”</p>

Les Knight wants you dead. Not right now though, he doesn’t want to bury you neck-high in a desert and cover you in honey, or lock you in a septic tank at the bottom of his farm. No, he’s more sociopassive than sociopathic. Les just wants to see you die out quietly and happily of old age; just please try not to leave any kids behind.<br>

The most intelligent comment came from a Perrier-drinker female at the bar. "The biggest problem that will solve itself is the presence of the most pestilent species on this planet: the human race," she said.
She turned out to be a supporter of the Voluntary Human Extinction Society. Run by a guy called Les U. Knight, this group aims to encourage humans to stop having babies because Earth would be a much nicer place without people.<br>
As soon as humanity vanishes, all the horrors of modern existence, including wars, bombs, torture, crime, High School Musical, Hello Kitty and so on simply vanish.<br>
It all sounds brilliant. Yet there’s got to be something wrong with this argument. I’m just not sure what it is.</p>

Excerpts:<br>
You come across nutty-sounding fringe groups like the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement, but then you phone its founder, Les Knight—he’s a
supply teacher, based on America’s west coast, and can only talk during
breaks between lessons – only to discover that he isn’t nutty at all, but
in fact rather sane and self-deprecating. (He simply wants people to choose
not to breed. "Eventually we’ll be extinct anyway, but it would be so much
nicer if we phased ourselves out through natural attrition," Knight told me
affably. "You know – the way a company reduces its workforce without firing
anyone.")<br>
...<br>
But the hostility to both childlessness and one-child families explains why
the OPT’s campaign targeting British people is called Stop At Two. (The
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement objects strongly: "Rather than stop at
two, we should stop at once," says Les Knight.)

Excerpt:<br>
The end of man?<br>
Some experts now believe little can be done; others think there is still room
for hope. For Les Knight, however, there is only solution: an end to
humanity. The only solution, Knight says, is to eradicate Homo sapiens, not
through violent means but merely by deciding not to reproduce. Without
billions of protein-hungry, top-of-the-food-chain carnivores devouring the
planet’s resources, other creatures would have a chance. Hence his
establishment in the US of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. “We are
the humanitarian alternative to human disasters,” says Knight. “Each time
a child is prevented then the planet gets another chance to breath.” Knight
spreads his message via the Internet and claims tens of thousands of
followers. Dubbed ‘eco-sexuals’ by the US press, these voluntary
extinction supporters follow the movement’s simple creed: “Live long and
die out”. It is amusing but not that serious an option for humanity. It is
not in any species’ nature to seek its own extinction. Nevertheless,
Knight’s ideas are provocative and do have resonance. “As numbers drop,
the last humans will benefit particularly,” he says. “They will
experience our world as it should be enjoyed—without billions of people on
it.” [<a href="http://www.gmagazine.com.au/node/1089/full">Full

fact, precisely the goal of the most extreme childlessness advocates out

“The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) believes that ‘phasing
out the human race by voluntarily ceasing to breed will allow Earth’s
biosphere to return to good health’, and point to Chernobyl as an example
of an ecosystem recovering when abandoned by humans. “Most of us are aware
on some level that there are more of us than Earth can support, and evidence
is becoming increasingly hard to ignore,” Les U. Knight from VHEMT told
More Than Living. “The connections between quality of life and quantity of
humanity surround us.” Knight is hopeful that with the support of household
names such as Attenborough, individual awareness of the “overpopulation”
issue will spread, providing the first step to social change. “Government
policies always lag behind social evolution, particularly with
emotionally-charged issues, and social traditions lag behind changes in the
real world,” he said. “Individual awareness, however, often leaps ahead
when the right information comes along at the right time.” “If all
couples would just think before they breed, fertility rates would be greatly
improved. Most of us have never considered not breeding. Before sentencing a
new human to life, a couple could consider what environmental conditions will
be for the next 80 years.” </p>

The typically docile fringe of the [environmental] movement has chosen to go out with a bang, however, by hammering the last nail into its own coffin via the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. VHEMT (pronounced “vehement”—how clever!) calls for its members to remain childless, arguing that the damage human beings cause to the environment is so great that the world would be a much better place without us. Founder Les U. Knight—again, so clever I don’t know whether to laugh or cry—might be one of the more moderate members of the American extinction crew; he proposes it should be completely voluntary and occur within a time frame that is appropriate, while colleagues like author Alan Weisman propose the Chinese solution: a governmental mandate to prohibit families from having more than one child.<br>
“Let’s unite in peace and love and not make any more kids,” sounds like a great idea for Starbucks poets and basket weavers from sea to shining sea, but it might take the more sensible populace of the United States a little time to warm up to the idea. Little thought was given to how Knight’s explanation that “as long as there’s one breeding pair of homo sapiens, there’s too great a threat to the biosphere,” would play in the mainstream. Moreover, how the already low-fertility American population would be able to offset population gains elsewhere in the world remains shrouded in mystery. Given that the population growth in this country relies as heavily on immigration as it does on births, it seems unlikely that VHEMT will find an audience even among the darkest fringes of the green movement. <a href="http://vhemt.org/offdeepend.htm">Full article</a>.</p>

refrain from procreating”</strong></a><br>
The fastest way to a greener planet? Some think a ban on procreation is
simplest and best<br>
Brian Bethune<br>
August 6, 2007<br>
That the planet is in environmental crisis is a truth(almost)universally
recognized, but the nature of the crisis doesn’t command nearly the same
unanimity. Is it because our activities now threaten our survival, or because
the weight of humanity—all 6.5 billion planet-eating, carbon-spewing
individuals—lies too heavily upon the rest of what was once known as
creation? Those who express the latter view are often dismissed, sometimes
maliciously, as being anti-human, madmen who regard the fate of Amazonian
butterflies or Arctic bears as having the same moral value as human life.
Mostly such accusations are baseless—you don’t have to hate humanity to
value the rest of nature—but there are, in fact, a lot of people who think
the most useful thing humanity could do is disappear, in whole or in
part...<br>
In Oregon, America’s only euthanasia-friendly state, schoolteacher Les
Knight, head of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, makes it all sound
perfectly idyllic. Talking to Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us
(HarperCollins)-- a marvellous projection of what life would be like on a
human-free earth—Knight describes what he sees as the best path to the
inevitable. Brutal resource wars, starvation and epidemics are going to mow
us down anyway, as our growing numbers come up against the world’s finite
resources. So much the better that we should “all agree to stop
procreating.” Abortion providers going out of business would be the first
happy result, in Knight’s opinion. Soon, “there would be no more children
under five dying horribly. In 21 years, there would be, by definition, no
juvenile delinquency.” There would finally be enough to eat, even while
nature was staging a recovery from our depredations; with nothing to fight
over, war would end. “The last humans could enjoy their final sunsets
peacefully, knowing they have returned the planet as close as possible to the
Garden of Eden.” <br>
The logic is as absurd as it’s unassailable. Yes, indeed, if there are no
more children, there will be no more child tragedies. Or child triumphs, for
that matter, or much reason to think childless humanity will spend its dying
days as serenely as Knight predicts. In The Children of Men, P. D. James’s
scarifying 1992 dystopia, the dispiriting consequences of mass infertility(a
collective loss of the will to live) are far more believably depicted.<br>
Yet, as Weisman notes, Knight’s lament does catch some of “the weariness
that genuinely humane beings feel as they witness the collapse of much
biology and beauty.” That’s why Weisman has another suggestion, one
“poignant and distressing, but not fatal”: limit every human female on
earth to one child only. The math suddenly turns positive... [<a href="http://www.macleans.ca/science/environment/article.jsp?content=20070806_108079_108079&amp;page=1">Full

According to the San Francisco Chronicle (Nov. 16), the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement (VHEMT, pronounced “vehement”) is dedicated to
phasing out the human race so that the Earth’s biosphere might return to
good health. VHEMT founder Les U. Knight, who had a vasectomy at age 25, told
the Chronicle that “Wherever humans live, not much else lives.” His
solution is a simple one: Every man and woman should “voluntarily cease to
breed” -- that means, of course, sterilization, abortion, contraception,
and sometimes infanticide. VHEMT’s motto: “May we live long and die out.
Thank you for not breeding.” [Abortion and infanticide? Sterilization and
contraception prevent abortion, and infanticide requires breeding—thank you
for not doing so. Turns out they are “championing the cause of orthodox,
traditional Catholicism!” Some distortion of the truth may be expected for
the cause.]<br>

All will have heard of the fiery debate about the population of our planet. A
group says there are too many of us and that we must slow down the birth
rate, another group says that the alarm is exaggerated and it is only a
problem of better distribution of people and resources. Behind all this there
are massive economic interests that complicate the discussion. To one group
belong organizations that favor birth control and support abortion. The other
group includes large religious institutions such as the Catholic Church. The
Vhemt attempts to go beyond the two blocks, promoting the voluntary
extinction of the human race for the common good.<br>
The founder, Les Knight, maintains that we are hurtful to the universe.
Wherever we appear, the environment and other species begin to suffer. “It
is not that we are constitutionally bad. We consume resources and destroy
life”. Environmentalists’ efforts to make our species less lethal are
moving but useless, because in any event we will continue to annihilate
nature with our exponential growth.<br>
Apart from a few tribes of long ago and lost in the darkness of time, no
human aggregation was able to organize a sustainable system of living. The
only way out is extinction. The (Vhemt) movement does not advocate suicide.
Its slogan is “Let us live a long life and disappear”. Its strategy,
however, is to convince all humans to stop reproducing, as there are no
reasons for continuing to do so.<br>
Knight has an answer for those who point out that even humans are part of
nature—therefore every environmentalist would have the duty to preserve
them, just like the other animals. Knight responds with the data on the
destruction carried out by humans on the earth. “Our presence on earth has
already brought many species to extinction. Given this it is difficult to
maintain that we live in harmony with nature”. Still, the founder of Vhemt
is a realist. “I do not think we will succeed in convincing all humans to
carry out this supreme act of generosity towards our planet. But this does
not mean it is not the right cause, for which we will continue to
fight.”<br>

“We want to make children extinct” [reads the huge headline. Just
children, mind you, not adults.]<br>
December 6, 2005 [Not available online]<br>
“Every hour, 16,000 babies are born. But one organisation wants to put a
stop to it. And its members are willing to go to bizarre extremes to get
their way. Gregory Dicum speaks to the founder, while Lorna MacLaren talks to
members.” [The “bizarre extremes” we are willing to go to? They
didn’t say, but I assume they mean vasectomies. This is a reprint of the
November 16th San Francisco Chronicle article with interviews,excerpted
below, as a side bar.]<br>
“May we live long and die out” is a motto that even some followers of the
Voluntary Human Extinction Movement find extreme. Rodney Marsh, 41
(pictured), has been interested in the global population boom for many years.
When he saw the VHEMT website during an internet search he was immediately
drawn. “It’s a subject people don’t want to talk about yet it affects
us all,” says the electrician from his home in Sussex.<br>
“Modern culture is about living for today without any thought for the
consequences. However, statistics for global warming, population growth, food
production and pollution add up to a pretty gloomy picture for the future.
That is why I chose not to have children.”<br>
He has considered having a vasectomy, and would have had one long ago but for
his reservations about surgery. Marsh admits he is not entirely comfortable
with the “extinction” element of the VHEMT message. “It makes us sound
like some kind of extreme suicide group,” he says. “I think people are on
the planet for a reason and I have enough optimism to hope that the decline
may be reversed if we do something soon.”<br>
Jason Reynolds, of Oregon, US, hopes the existence of the VHEMT group at
least brings the population debate out for discussion. He is committed to
easing the pressure on the planet caused by humanity and had a vasectomy aged
29.<br>
“I saw a bumper sticker for the group and thought it was a joke. After
checking online I realised how much of a reality it was and how it had the
potential to snowball into something more important than many people give it
credit for.<br>
“I think humanity is reaching a critical junction that requires behaviour
modification.”<br>

Like me, Les Knight, founder of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, is
exhausted as well.<br>
“We can’t be breeding right now,” Knight told the San Francisco
Chronicle. “It’s obvious that the intentional creation of another (human
being) can’t be justified by anyone anywhere today, because wherever humans
live not much else lives.”<br>
I imagine that Mr. Knight (who, by the way, got a vasectomy when he was 25)
is also a vegan, does not drive or drives an electric vehicle, uses purely
solar or wind powered energy, recycles, reuses and reduces, and has a
beautiful garden.<br>
His solution to global problems is also more extreme than most of us probably
consider but, crazy or not, Knight certainly has a valid point.<br>

“Group Wants to See Humans Extinct” [That would be pretty difficult to

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 (UPI)—Make no mistake about it, the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement isn’t anti-child, it’s more like anti-human.<br>
The VHE is dedicated to phasing out the human race in the interest of the
health of the Earth, founder Les Knight told Wednesday’s San Francisco
Chronicle.<br>
With 16,000 people born per hour and a current global population of 6.5
billion, there are already more than enough people on the planet, Knight
said.<br>
A 1994 study concluded a single person born in the 1990s would be responsible
during a lifetime for 22 million pounds of liquid waste and 2.2 million
pounds each of solid waste and atmospheric waste, the newspaper said. He or
she will have a lifetime consumption of 4,000 barrels of oil, 1.5 million
pounds of minerals and 62,000 pounds of animal products that will necessitate
the slaughter of 2,000 animals.<br>
‘Wherever humans live, not much else lives,’ Knight said. ‘It isn’t
that we’re evil and want to kill everything—it’s just how we
live.’<br>
Knight, who had a vasectomy at age 25, emphasizes VHE likes kids and says
many of its members are parents as well as children.<br>

Maybe None: Is having a child—even one—environmentally
destructive?”</strong></a><br>
November 16, 2005<br>
Gregory Dicum<br>
[The following excerpt has been dropped from the article. Emphasis added]:<br>
Like most environmentalists—even most Americans—the Brunes have taken
steps to reduce their environmental impact.<br>
“We certainly do as much as we can to limit our consumption,” says Mike
Brune. “We made sure we live near mass transit. We have one of the new
Priuses. We buy organic food almost exclusively. We feel that it’s very
important to connect our personal values to all aspects of how we live: where
we work, what we eat, what we buy.”<br>
But when, after six and a half years of marriage, it came time for the couple
to consider a child, those strong personal values came up against an even
stronger drive.<br>
<em>“I understand rationally the argument for not having children</em>—I can see
the point,” says Mary Brune, a technical writer and, since becoming a
mother, co-founder of Making Our Milk Safe, an organization that monitors
industrial toxins in human milk.<br>
“I’ve talked to friends who have made certain that they can’t have
children so they don’t bring another person into the world,” she
continues. <em>“But for us there’s a real primal need to have a child. For
me, personally, I had a desire to bear my own child.</em>”<br>
So they went for it: Their daughter Olivia is now 15 months old.<br>
At RAN [<a href="http://www.ran.org/">Rainforest Action Network</a>], Mike
Brune works to transform some of the most powerful elements of our society,
going after oil companies and banks to change the way they do business. He
says that for him this kind of <em>big-picture environmentalism doesn’t
translate to the personal decision of whether to have a child.</em><br>
“The goal here isn’t for Safeway to have one aisle of organic
food—it’s to get to a point where all food is produced in a healthy
way,” he says. “The same would be true of hybrid cars: We don’t want
Ford Motor Co. to just have a few hybrid vehicles, we want to have every
vehicle nonpolluting.” For Mike Brune, <em>the choice to have a child is a
personal, emotional one that sits apart from the systemic change he’s
working for.</em><br>

“I’m busy thinking about the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement

They want me to die. They want you to die too! They want everyone to die.
It’s horrible!”<br>
[John must have missed the first statement on the VHEMT site. Fortunately, an

TO THE MERCURY: You're weaving a web of drivel and misinformation... Incorrectly, Mr. Dooley whines about VHEMT, "They want me to die. They want you to die too." Does Dooley have his paranoid head up his ass or what? In fact, one of VHEMT's mottos is "May we live long and die out." It doesn't take a rocket scientist wanna-be to figure out we are a species out of control and should consider not procreating, as there are a few billion too many of us already. What part of “voluntary” do you not understand? Bottom line: they want you to voluntarily not procreate.<br>

VHEMT’s viewpoints are a far cry from those of more mainstream
organizations concerned with human overpopulation,&nbsp;such as Washington,
D.C.-based Population Action International. Whereas VHEMT’s ultimate goal
is to improve the biosphere for its own sake, PAI’s goal is&nbsp;fundamentally
human-based.<br>
PAI says Mother Nature is resilient, and notes the Earth has recovered&nbsp;from
mass extinctions before—it just takes at least 5 million years to do so,
far too long for it to matter to human beings. . .<br>
Not surprisingly, organized religions like the Catholic Church dismiss
VHEMT’s claims.<br>
“We believe, as does every mainstream religion, that God made the world and
God made everything in the word,”&nbsp;according to&nbsp;New York Archdiocese
spokesman Joseph Zwilling. “It’s part of God’s plan of creation, and it
is absurd to suggest that the world would be better off without the human
race.”<p lingdex="20"></p>

Unfortunately the problem of human overpopulation does not stop at humanity’s boarder, it also plays havoc on animals and the environment. On a basic level, the more people there are, the more people there will be to eat meat, wear fur, go to circuses and rodeos, hunt and demand animal research. It wouldn’t be a stretch of the imagination to figure that if America's population was half its current size, the number of animals slaughtered for food would also be halved. If this were the case, more than 3 billion animals per year would be spared the horrors of factory farming and the slaughterhouse.</p>

Two-page spread agrees with concept of voluntary human extinction—for an
unusual reason.<br>
“It is hard, indeed, to imagine any reason to be against voluntary human
extinction. The tricky question is not whether to extinguish, but when.
Certainly not right away, if only because, as yet, we can’t. As Mr Knight
himself says, “Convincing 6 billion people to stop breeding is indeed a
daunting task.” But there need be no rush. Look at it this way. For humans
to reach a state of such collective rational consensus that they become
capable of choosing their end may take a few millennia, or a few dozen or a
few hundred millennia; but this decision need only be made once. When even
the last few men and women left holding out answer the call to the sublime,
and choose to bear no more children—then that will be the species’ finest
hour. And so that will be the time to leave. The timetable of voluntarism is
perfect: it provides ample time, but not a day too much of it.”<br>

“I ended up, a couple years later, having a beer with a man who called

problem can be traced back to overpopulation—particularly in the first
world, since one of us consumes as many resources as 500 Ethiopians. Les was
not your stereotypical antipopulation activist; he worked as a substitute
teacher and was an outspoken advocate for children’s rights. In fact, he
saw population control as an issue linked inextricably to children’s
welfare since, according to him, 40,000 kids die of malnutrition every day.
Hanging out with Les made me realize that there are many ways to be a mother.
Some of us will bear babies, and some of us will adopt, and some of us will
march with signs, and some of us will volunteer, and some of us will watch

“Founded by a schoolteacher named Les Knight, the Voluntary Human

<blockquote>
  Chapter 4: The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement’s motto is “May we
  live long and die out.” They encourage a radical alternative to our
  callous extinction of plants and animals. “Each time another one of us
  decides to not add another one of us to the burgeoning billions already
  squatting on this ravaged planet, another ray of hope shines through the
  gloom.” The philosophies of abstinence held by these three groups
  [Shakers, Heaven’s Gate, VHEMT] guarantee that “the gene stops here.”
  In summary, groups that insist upon celibacy will die off without an
  effective way of recruiting new converts. And even those celibate groups
  that manage to expand their ranks will logically eliminate themselves once
  they reach the hypothetical pinnacle of success: recruitment of the entire
  human race. These sorts of groups are eligible for a Darwin Award. Catholic
  priests, homosexuals who manage to reproduce despite their sexual
  preferences, and similar groups can theoretically exist eternally, and are
  not eligible for this notorious award. </blockquote>
In a sense, we are advocating “abstinence” but not from sexual activity,
just from breeding. This distinction isn’t relevant to a group Darwin
Award, but our “effective way of recruiting new converts” disqualifies
VHEMT. <br>
<a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/">The Darwin Awards</a> give us
entertaining stories and thoughtful discussions about their veracity and
implications for evolution, but in reality the removal of a few thousand, or even a few million,
people from our gene pool will have no discernable influence on future Homo
sapiens. <br>
A commonly expressed misconception about advocates of voluntary human
extinction is that we’ll die out in one generation because we aren’t
passing on our genes, as if there’s a gene for awareness of humanity’s
place in the biosphere. All of us came from breeding couples and yet we’ve
decided to stop breeding. There’s no way to breed more people who don’t
want to breed in order to keep the idea of not breeding alive. <br>
Humans do, on the other hand, influence <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news151002984.html">evolution of other
species</a>, the ones we don’t drive to extinction anyway.

8 February 2011	<br>
Two new plays show that climate change is better understood as a moral issue rather than a scientific one.
...The Heretic is not so much the scientific controversy as the cultural, even psychological context in which it unfolds. As representatives of contemporary youth, both Ben and Phoebe are frankly pretty fucked up. Phoebe is dangerously anorexic, while Ben also has a dysfunctional relationship with food, though on environmentalist grounds (he does eat plenty of garlic, to reduce his personal ‘carbon emissions’); similar qualms keep him from enjoying fossil fuel-derived heat and transport. The two also share a hostility to the idea of having children—<strong>Ben is a member of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</strong>. It seems pretty clear that it is their negative attitudes to humanity in general and themselves in particular that explain their attraction to environmentalist thinking, rather than the former being derived from a sober consideration of humanity’s effect on the world.</p>

“The controversial environmental and philosophical movement, which recommends that the human race voluntary stop breeding to allow the Earth’s biosphere to return to its former glory, claims that human extinction is possible and inevitable, and that humans represent the only species evolved enough to consciously go extinct for the good of all life.”</p>

Nothing can change us<br>
No one can save us from ourselves<br>

“This week we debate whether or not having kids is a good idea. We talk to the founder of The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement about his beliefs that, for the betterment of the planet, all human beings should stop procreating until the species is extinct. We talk to a pastor who had an affair that resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. We talk to a mother about just how much fun it is to raise a tiny little person. Also, Colleen wants to ‘pop out’ so many babies before she ‘dries up’. It’s a big episode this week. Enjoy!”</p>

Dori didn’t like the concept from the beginning. Maybe it had something to
do with his three daughters. He’s a serious host and I wasn’t successful
in trying to lighten things up. The callers didn’t help in that regard.
Gene told us that we only have five billion years and all life will go—just
to keep things in perspective. Jason is Wiccan and his temple demands that
all followers produce at least one biological offspring, so he was offended
by my suggesting we not breed. Weldon and I got into a semantical loop when
he suggested that everything is natural and I said we could then get rid of
the word “artificial”. Jeremy agreed because we’ll go involuntarily if
we don’t go voluntarily. Maurene was offended in the same way that Jason
was, though she’s Christian with offspring. Dori ended our segment with an aside, “I wish someone had extincted
me an hour ago.”<br>

equivalent of a year’s emissions from 1,700 cars. Full episode included

Interview with Les Knight starts at 49:00. Video of Alex on the air doesn’t quite match the audio, but it’s a radio program.</div>
<br>Alex promotes an odd conspiracy theory about human “depopulation” by the
“elite” who want to eliminate billions of us with a disease or poison
from contrails so they can have the planet to themselves. Somehow those in
power preventing people from accessing contraceptive services secretly want
fewer people. Must be trying to lull us into thinking otherwise. With the
