<p lingdex="0"><strong>V</strong> stands for Voluntary - a value to keep foremost
among us as conditions change. The V shape also depicts the confluence of
logic and love to make a receptive and balanced point.<br>
<br>
Our world is shown undergoing a revolution of 180 degrees: the opposite view
of what we're used to. Our direction must shift radically for us to preserve
life and restore ecosystems. Also, upside down emblems are symbols of
distress.<br>
<br>
The VHEMT concept goes over the whole world. Hanging banners is essential to
getting our message across. Without a label, people don't know what to
think.
