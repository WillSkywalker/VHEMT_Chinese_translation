<b>问：VHEMT 支持中国的计划生育政策吗？</b> 

<p lingdex="5">中国政府的人口政策和我们的观点有两处冲突：首先，它不是自愿性的；其次，即使一个孩子也太多了。政府鼓励夫妇生育一个孩子而不是不生育。</p>

<p lingdex="6">如果我们不能尽快降低出生率的话，像中国这样严厉的政策极有可能也离我们不远了。这一政策的支持者们认为，比起让刚出生的孩子们在营养不良中缓慢而痛苦地死去，还不如剥夺夫妇生二胎的权利。反对者们则认为，传统上农村地区的人们一直将自己的后代作为劳动力，并且视生男孩为吉兆。由于传统上妻子会到丈夫的家庭去照顾公婆，儿子被父母当作将来养老的保障。城市化和性别比列失衡也许会逐渐改变这一点。
</p>

<p lingdex="7">To avoid creating an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11288492">adequate plan</a> to care for the elderly, China’s government now allows couples who are both only children to create two
offspring. These children won’t be taking care of too many ancestors as the
family pyramid is inverted. Fewer than one third of eligible mothers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/world/asia/11china.html">surveyed in 2009</a> said they wanted a second child.</p>

<p lingdex="8">China’s one-child policy, instituted in 1979, has slowed their increase to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People">6.6
million</a> a year, and has prevented their current 1.3 billion from being
300 to 400 million more, though much of that could be because couples prefer to stop at one. Their goal is to peak at 1.6 billion around 2050. Total Fertility Rate is estimated to be between 
<a href="http://today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1597">1.5</a> and 
<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People">1.8</a>
in 2008. </p>

<p lingdex="9">Rather than looking at coercive methods of reducing births, let’s
first stop coercing procreation and start allowing self-determination. If
reproductive freedom were universal—if all who wanted to avoid reproducing
were able to do so—growth of human population would be slowed by nearly
40%: from 78 million per year to 48 million. <a href="http://www.colby.edu/personal/t/thtieten/pop-chi.html">Research</a>
suggests government mandates alone are not enough: personal preferences must
also change for long-term success.</p>

<p lingdex="10">Increasing awareness is necessary to help everyone realize that the
intentional creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can’t be
justified today—not ecologically, ethically, economically, nor even
selfishly.</p>

<p lingdex="11">A combination of reproductive freedom and responsibility is needed:
freedom to avoid procreation, and responsibility to use that freedom.<br>

<b>Q: Should human migration be controlled to help Earth’s ecosystems?</b> 

<center>
<h2>Migration: The Old In and Out</h2>
</center>

<p lingdex="17">IN-migration or immigration—out-migration or emigration—we use these
labels to tell if people are coming or going, but the distinction merely
reveals an observer’s bias. People moving in someplace always move out of
some place else: they are immigrants and emigrants at the same time.</p>

<p lingdex="18">Within the borders of freer countries like the United States, migration is
determined mainly by economics and personal preference. Between countries,
however, restrictions on migration are plentiful and often capricious.
Enforcement is always at gun point.</p>

<p lingdex="19">It has been suggested that increasing these restrictions will reduce
population growth, and will therefore benefit the environment. However,
looking at Earth from a broader perspective, say from space, reveals that all
those lines arbitrarily dotted across the planet do not help the biosphere as
a whole.</p>

<p lingdex="20">If one of the methods we choose for preserving Earth’s ecosystems is to
draw lines on the ground and dare people to step over them, we should be
drawing them around wilderness preserves, as many African nations are doing.
Restrictions on in-migration are needed in the remaining vestiges of Nature,
in the fragile ecosystems which can’t absorb more human impact.</p>

<p lingdex="21">Urban and suburban growth boundaries also help reduce out-migration into
less-spoiled areas. Cities will get more crowded until birth rates drop, but
perhaps birth rates will drop as cities get more crowded, and as people give
up the fantasy of someday “moving out to the country.”</p>

<p lingdex="22">The idea of restricting our own migration within our borders may not have
the appeal that restricting in-migration by foreigners has, but for Earth’s
sake, that’s the direction we should be migrating in.</p>

<p lingdex="23">Naturally, the best in-migration control is birth control. May we live
long and die OUT.</p>

<p lingdex="24">[Human migration control is beyond the scope of VHEMT, so many differing
opinions on the subject are included among Volunteers and Supporters. The
above is my opinion. Les.]<br>

<b>Q: Will smart growth preserve green space around urban areas?</b><br>
<br>
Like sustainable development, smart growth is an oxymoron. Planners,
builders, and activists have been arguing whether their cities should grow up
or out. Now a growing number are advocating neither one. They are asking,
“If we’re growing smart, why are we getting so dense?”<br>
<br>
Attempts to control human migration may temporarily preserve agricultural
land and tree farms, but as long as our demand for living room increases,
it’s only a temporary stay of execution. <br>
<br>
Portland, Oregon has an Urban Growth Boundary to control sprawl. The
development shown below is within the boundary lines, so it’s not really
sprawl, it’s “smart growth”. Reducing encroachment into natural habitat
is essential to wildlife preservation, but like all attempts to control human
migration, it’s only a temporary fix as long as our numbers continue to
increase.<br>

<b>Q: What about our right to breed? Could VHEMT eventually lead to
coercion?</b> 

<p lingdex="30">While we righteously argue against coercive methods to improve birth
rates, let’s keep in mind that coercion is already with us. Reproductive
rights are not universally respected, so we already have coercion and
involuntary population control. Hundreds of millions of couples want to avoid
conceptions, and are denied this right. Where is the outrage at this
coercion?</p>

<p lingdex="31">Advocates of coerced contraception are vilified as “ecofascists,”
while advocates of coerced births are respectfully called “pro-life”.</p>

<p lingdex="32">Although the VHEMT concept precludes curtailing reproductive choices,
irresponsible breeding is curtailing rights of all of us: our right to
breathe clean air, drink clean water, to find solitude and quiet, and
eventually, our right to procreate without restrictions. As <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1089552##">Carter J. Dillard</a>
states, "No right, procreation included, is limitless if it is capable of
conflicting with other valid and perhaps hierarchically superior rights." </p>

<p lingdex="33">We are also abridging the rights of other species by converting their
habitat to ours. Driving a species to extinction is the ultimate act of
ecofascism.</p>

<p lingdex="34">When breeding is an unquestioned right, we are also guaranteeing the right
to breed slave labor, and to sentence someone to life in a rapidly
deteriorating environment. A solid case could be made that procreation today
is de facto child abuse.</p>

<p lingdex="35">Eighty million unwanted conceptions occur each year, most because of
prohibitions on contraceptive services. <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/rph/data/abortion.htm">Forty-five
million</a> of those are not carried to full term. <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/rh/planning.htm">Seventy-four thousand</a> women
die and five million suffer injuries from complications of unsafe
abortions—an outrageous violation of basic human rights. Each year, roughly
35 million babies are denied their right to not be born into a family that
doesn’t want them or can’t provide for their needs.</p>

<p lingdex="36">Those of us who love freedom, and who realize that none are free as long
as anyone is oppressed, will continue to promote universal reproductive
freedom and responsibility.</p>
