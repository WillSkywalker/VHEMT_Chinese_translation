<h2>DEATH</h2>
</div>


<p lingdex="0"><a name="mortality"></a> 
<strong>Q: Will new viruses, wars, famine, and toxic
waste help the cause of human extinction?</strong></p>

<p lingdex="1">No. Epidemics actually strengthen a species if enough of them are living
to have an adequate survival rate. With nearly seven billion of us, there is no
virus that could get us all. A 99.99% die off would still leave more than 700,000
naturally-immune survivors to replicate, and in less than 50,000 years we
could be right back where we are now. For any disease to simply hold the
human population where it is, more than 200,000 of us would have to succumb
to it each day. Suffering and death cannot help but hurt.</p>

<p lingdex="2">Millions have died in wars and yet the human family continues to increase.
Most of the time, wars encourage both the winners and losers to re-populate.
When troops are called up for invations, sperm banks take deposits hand over
fist. The net result of war is usually an increase rather than a decrease in
total population size.</p>

<p lingdex="3">Resource shortages are dealt with by resorting to mass murder and calling
it war, but the results are only temporary. Besides being impractical,
killing people is immoral. It should never be considered as a way to improve
life on Earth.</p>

<p lingdex="4">The massive die-off of humanity, predicted by so many as a result of our
overshoot of Earth’s carrying capacity, is what the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement hopes to avoid.</p>

<p lingdex="5">It’s possible that VHEMT will not succeed in staving off ecological
collapse. So, couples contemplating procreation may want to consider the
possibility that they will be sentencing their off-spring to a
rapidly-deteriorating quality of life and unimaginably horrible death.</p>

<p lingdex="6">Something to think about, anyway.<br>

<strong>Q: Are we all supposed to kill ourselves?</strong> 

<p lingdex="7">SUMMARY: Increasing human deaths will not improve population density. Many
people are advocating an increase in the death rate to reduce human
population numbers. However, increased death has historically increased
births. Promoting reproductive freedom, economic opportunity, and education
will shrink our masses faster and nicer.</p>


<div align="center">
<h3>Grim Reaper to the Rescue?</h3>
</div>

<p lingdex="8">Will super hero Grim Reaper pull our precious Gaia from the brink of
ecological catastrophe in time? Will generous, sweeping strokes of his deadly
scythe mow down millions of humans, stopping us before we destroy ourselves
and our host?</p>

<p lingdex="9">Grim Reaper’s henchmen, Famine, Disease, and War, joined lately by
mutant cousin, Plutonium, are harvesting as fast as ever, and haven’t
kept up with our rank growth.</p>

<p lingdex="10">Yet, despite Death’s dismal record for slowing human population
growth, some today advocate utilizing more of his services for the benefit of
all. They’re trying to make the Grim Reaper look good.</p>

<p lingdex="11">Like Pentti Linkola of Saaksmaki, Finland, quoted in the Wall Street
Journal (1) Another world war, he says (in Finnish), would be “a happy
occasion for the planet ... If there were a button I could press, I would
sacrifice myself without hesitating if it meant millions would die.
”</p>

<p lingdex="12">He didn’t say how many millions he wants to play lemming with, but
even 80 million would only eliminate one year’s growth. It wouldn't
rescue Gaia, and we’d be stuck with all those bodies. Yuck. Even the
late <a href="http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/stalkers/hardin.html">Garrett
Hardin</a>, who said that feeding starving people just makes more starving
people, balked at Linkola's hard-nosed philosophy: “We have many
possibilities which should be explored before we take a strong-arm
approach,” he cautioned.</p>

<p lingdex="13">Weekly World News (2) tells the story of two escaped French chemists,
Henri Mevel and Jean-Michael DuPont, who allegedly plan to poison every human
on the planet to “save it from pollution and overpopulation. “
Interpol’s Marc Jubert admits, “we don’t know exactly what
Mevel and DuPont are making but if we don’t stop them in time the
results will be devastating... They may be mad, but they aren’t
crazy.”</p>

<p lingdex="14">Well, even with their “network of 2,000 radical environmentalists
around the world,” there’s no way they’ll even approach
Linkola’s magic-button body count: a paltry 2% of us.</p>

<p lingdex="15">A Newhouse News Service (3) story about former CIA chief of
counter-terrorism, Vincent M. Cannistraro also belongs in the Weekly World
News. He envisions “highly educated scientists... (in) small organized
clandestine cells working on the development of technologies to diminish or
even eliminate the race of man [sic] from the Earth.” The article also
cites the voluntary human extinction movement, in hopes of adding credence to
this fantasy.</p>

<p lingdex="16">There may very well be well-funded, clandestine cells of scientists
working to eliminate large numbers of people. However, saving planet Earth is
probably not one of their motives.</p>

<p lingdex="17">The Church of Euthanasia advocates what many think of when they hear about
VHEMT for the first time: suicide for Earth’s sake. Founder Chris
Korda, in their newsletter Snuff It, (4) encourages those who are truly
serious about saving the planet to kill themselves. Also offered are several
creative ways to help the cause of voluntary human extinction.</p>

<p lingdex="18">The Gaia Liberation Front (5) favors people killing each other as in wars,
but prefers “hand-to-hand combat, or better yet, biological agents that
kill only humans.”</p>

<p lingdex="19">No matter how many millions are sacrificed by the Grim Reaper, and for
whatever reason, benefits to Gaia would be minimal. In fact, high death rates
cause high birth rates, often resulting in a net increase. Post-war baby
booms quickly replace the dead of both victor and vanquished.</p>

<p lingdex="20">In Wild Earth, (6) I examine the infamous Bubonic Plague’s effect on
western civilization’s census report: “Immediately after this
minor blip, our numbers began to shoot for the moon. The industrial
revolution was no doubt a factor in allowing us to burgeon to the bursting
point, but the Black Death may be the reason we want to breed like bunnies.
Burned into our collective memory was the horror of massive deaths of our
kind. Our reaction as a species, naturally, has been fertility with a
vengeance.”</p>

<p lingdex="21">To cope with this rampant fertility, I conclude, “...reproductive
freedom, economic opportunity, and education are far more effective methods
of improving the ratio of people-to-wildlife than promoting death could ever
be.”</p>

<p lingdex="22">No, the Grim Reaper is not Gaia’s knight in shining armor - he
can’t just kill the stork. We are the potential heroes of this rescue.
If enough members of the human family become vehement about preserving life
on Earth, fair Gaia has a prayer.</p>

<strong>Q: Won’t VHEMT die out when all its members die off?</strong><p lingdex="24"></p>

<p lingdex="25">If an idea lacks enough merit to be passed on without being force-fed from an
early age, it probably deserves to be forgotten.</p>

<p lingdex="26">Awareness isn’t passed along in our genes. Every VHEMT Volunteer or
Supporter is the result of a breeding couple, and yet we have all decided to
stop reproducing. Often, we arrived at this conclusion independently and
without support from friends and family.</p>

<p lingdex="27">The concept of voluntary human extinction has a life of its own. It’s
an idea whose time has come, though it may be a little late.</p>

<strong>Q: Why don’t you just kill yourself?</strong><p lingdex="28"></p>

<p lingdex="29">This could be the most frequently asked question of all. Fair enough
question: if we’re so bad for whatever habitat we’re occupying,
why don’t we just stop it? There are several reasons why retroactive
birth control isn’t a part of VHEMT.</p>

<p lingdex="30">As explained above, increasing death is like trying to bail out a sinking
boat without plugging the leak. People are flooding in twice as fast as
they’re bailing out.</p>

<p lingdex="31">It’s hard enough just to get people to consider not breeding.
Advocating suicide, by any method besides old age, would be a particularly
hard sell. There’s no way we could convince enough people to kill
themselves to make a difference, especially after we’re too dead to
talk. Suicide doesn’t set an example others will follow.</p>

<p lingdex="32">Death comes soon enough -- far too soon for many of us. After working most of
our lives, a dozen years of retirement isn’t too much to ask. Those
years may be dedicated to humanitarian and environmental causes.</p>

<p lingdex="33">Shortening an existing person’s life by a few decades doesn’t
avoid as many years of human impact as not creating a whole new life -- one
with the potential for producing more of us.</p>

<p lingdex="34">We have a responsibility to help the world as much as we’re able before
we die. Leaving the work for others would be irresponsible.</p>

<p lingdex="35">VHEMT is a cause to live for not to die for.</p>

<hr>

<strong>Q: Is this another one of those suicide cults?</strong><p lingdex="37"></p>

<p lingdex="38">Seems as if our entire industrialized civilization is one big suicide
cult. The symptoms surround us.</p>

<p lingdex="39">We propel our bodies about in fragile metal boxes, at potentially fatal
speeds, without much care or reason.</p>

<p lingdex="40">We ingest so much poison that meat from our bones wouldn’t meet
government standards for pork.</p>

<p lingdex="41">We pull strands from the web of life, jump up and down on it, and expect it
to hold our ever-increasing weight. Few notice there’s no safety
net.</p>

<p lingdex="42">Instead, we could be embracing life: voluntary human extinction offers a
healthy cure for humanity’s collective death wish.</p>
