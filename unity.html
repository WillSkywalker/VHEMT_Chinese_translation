<h3><div align="center">We can agree on something if we try</div></h3>

<p lingdex="0">The old “divide and conquer” trick still works. In popular media,
this is called “showing both sides of the issue.” Often, we are shown
two aspects of the same side, and alternative views are
disregarded.</p>

<p lingdex="1">Most issues have more than two sides, but it’s hard to hold more
than two possibilities in our heads at the same time. This is not to
say people are stupid. In technology-driven societies we are
constantly bombarded with messages which present disconnected,
fractured, and false realities. It’s a wonder we can think at
all.</p>

<p lingdex="2">1) Loggers and environmentalist have a common interest in healthy
forest ecosystems, and shouldn’t allow themselves to be pitted
against each other by those who profit from exploiting both
environment and laborer. The choice isn’t between jobs and
environment, it’s which jobs are best for life and who gets the
fruits of their labor.</p>

<p lingdex="3">2) Anti-abortion and pro-choice groups would probably agree that
eliminating unwanted conceptions would virtually eliminate the need
for abortions.</p>

<p lingdex="4">3) Disagreements between deep ecologists and social ecologist are
just as counter-productive. Both approaches are needed at this time.
Social justice is needed to preserve what’s left of Earth’s
biosphere.</p>

<p lingdex="5">4) Differing approaches of environmentalists and animal rights
advocates are minor in the bigger picture of preserving all life on
Earth. The smaller our population, the fewer animals will be caged,
ridden, vivisected, hunted, slaughtered, and driven to
extinction.</p>

<p lingdex="6">5) Many VHEMT Volunteers and Supporters have procreated and many
have remained childfree. Still, we are all on the same side: it’s the
future that matters now. People who breed need help, not criticism.
Intentional breeding shows a need for help in taking responsibility
and in getting beyond denial. Coerced breeding shows a need for help
in gaining reproductive freedom.</p>

<p lingdex="7">6) Some say driving cars is destroying the biosphere so those who
drive can’t call themselves environmentalists. Others say eating meat
is the worst. Or is it patriarchy’s subjugation of women and Nature?
Capitalism and the greed which feeds it might be the culprit. Misuse
of religion, and societies’ natalist policies could be the causes.
Military activities do more damage than any other criminal
institution. Compelling evidence "proves" any of these—and several
other causes—to be THE problem. Berating those who don’t choose
the same problem as us is a divisive waste of our energies. Each of
us has the right to follow our hearts and do whatever we think is
best. Tolerance and understanding of other’s choices will help us
unite for the common good.</p>

<p lingdex="8">No matter what directions we take to help Earth’s biosphere,
phasing out humans will greatly increase our chances for success. In
fact, solving <em>any</em> problem on Earth is impossible in the long run
without a reduction in our numbers.<br>
