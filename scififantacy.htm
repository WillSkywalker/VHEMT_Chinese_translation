<b>Q: Without us, who would protect Earth from extraterrestrial threats like
comets and asteroids?</b> 

<p lingdex="0">Mapping known asteroids’ paths is underway, with an increasing number of
<a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/">Near Earth Objects</a> (NEOs) and <a href="http://www.b612foundation.org/index.html">Near Earth Asteroids
(NEAs)</a> projected into the future and deemed clear of Earth’s path. A
lack of funding keeps this from progressing as it could, since it doesn’t
relate to power by one group of people over another, nor are profits likely
within the next quarter, if ever. </p>

<p lingdex="1">Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/1/America-s-Grand-Strategy--by-Stephen-Lendman-100908-890.html">militarization
of space,</a> despite treaties to the contrary, marches onward and upward
through efforts of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6063926.stm">US government</a>.
This “Star wars” project isn’t to protect Earth from extraterrestrial
threats, it’s to dominate the world. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6276543.stm">China</a> has
recently joined the potential arms race in space. Once again, rather than
being the best hope against global threats, humans are the greatest threat.
In fact, we aren’t just a threat: unlike that random uncharted asteroid
floating around out there somewhere, we’re actively causing deep impacts on
planet Earth.</p>

<p lingdex="2">Comets would be a bigger challenge than asteroids: we only learn about new
ones after it’s too late to do much about them with our current technology.
If we are to develop the means to deflect extra-terrestrial threats,
priorities will have to change. This could be done more easily with fewer of
us. If we can’t get the job done with six billion, we sure aren’t going
to do it with nine. Trying to keep up with our growing demands for resources
prevents us from making real progress.</p>

<p lingdex="3">There are threats to life on Earth which we have no power to stop. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano">supervolcano</a> blew in 535
near the island of Java and obscured the Sun for a year. Effects were global
and long-lasting, both on humans and the natural world. There are at least
seven more of these around the planet, including <a href="http://www.earthmountainview.com/yellowstone/yellowstone.htm">Yellowstone</a>,
which could do the same. There’s nothing we can do to control forces like
these.</p>

<p lingdex="4">We do have the power to eliminate one clear and present danger to
Earth’s biosphere: our own excessive presence. Our voluntary extinction
could mercifully prevent a major ecological collapse, if we act soon
enough.</p>

<p lingdex="6"><a name="clone"></a><b>Q: Why not clone extinct species from their DNA
codes?</b></p>

<p lingdex="7">Jurassic Park is a movie—it’s not possible in real life.</p>

<p lingdex="8">But, just for fun, let’s bring back the Tasmanian tiger, or Tasmanian
wolf if you prefer—real name thylacine (THIGH-luh-sign). Last known
survivor, shown here, died in Hobart Zoo in 1936.<br>
</p>

<div align="center">

<p lingdex="9"><br>
A baby specimen was preserved in alcohol in 1866, rather than DNA-destroying
formalin, and rests on a shelf in the Australian Museum. Offering the
pickled, pouched mammal for research, director Mike Archer, envisions
thylacines as pets within 50 years.</p>

<p lingdex="10">First, the DNA has to be decoded. No problem, with a big enough grant, but
that’s as far as we’ll get.</p>

<p lingdex="11">Enough species which used to live in and on the thylacine must also be
recreated from their DNA. Being microscopic and extinct is a good way to keep
from being found and decoded. Some species of bacteria, which are similar
enough to get the thylacine’s food digested, might exist in another
carnivorous marsupial—now where did they all get to?</p>

<p lingdex="12">Which brings up another obstacle: who’s the mommy? When daddy
Frankenstein breathes life into the accurately-DNA-encoded glob of inert
ingredients, it then has to grow inside an adult. In this case, one with a
nice warm pouch is preferred. Maybe a kangaroo will do, if our tiger cub
doesn’t bite too much.</p>

<p lingdex="13">So, assuming we’ve overcome those little details: got 10 or 20 micro
organisms recreated and kicking, found a way to create life from lifeless
matter, and found a surrogate mom—where will it call home?</p>

<p lingdex="14">Habitat loss causes most extinctions today. Ranchers converted thylacine
habitat into rangeland for livestock. When Tasmanian Tigers had the gall to
dine on the exotic lamb delivered to their homes, they were shot as
pests—bounties paid. Unless large expanses of rangeland are restored as
natural habitat—another monumental challenge for science and
politics—they would still be considered pests.</p>

<p lingdex="15">Livestock interests continue blocking efforts to reintroduce wolves,
grizzlies, and bison in western North America. Considerable ground for
wildlife could be gained if we pulled the subsidies feed bag from grazers,
and stopped buying their meat and by-products, but until we restore habitat
on a large scale, even wildlife that doesn’t have to be brought back from
the dead has no home.<br>

<p lingdex="20"><font size="+1"><a name="colonize"></a></font><b>Q: Why not move excess
human population to colonies on other planets?</b></p>

<p lingdex="21">That’s humanity for you: our sights are on the stars while we’re
sinking in toxic sludge. For space migration to keep our numbers stable, 100
space ships holding 2,000 people each would have to blast off every day: one
every 15 minutes. Contraception is cheaper.</p>

<p lingdex="22">New world colonization by Europeans didn’t relieve population pressure
in Europe—just increased it elsewhere.</p>

<p lingdex="23">What kind of life would we primates, barely out of the jungle, make for
ourselves in a space station? We aren’t domesticated enough to keep from
going bonkers in remote, desolate outposts like Antarctica. Anyway, who wants
to live inside a building for 10 or 20 years? To seriously imagine ourselves
living that way reveals the extent of our mental disconnect from Nature.</p>

<p lingdex="24">We barely live healthy lives in our artificial environments here on Earth.
Indoor air averages many times more toxic than outside air. Emotional stress
resembles that of captive animals—for good reason. Although our cage bars
may only be abstract, like the bars crossing the €, $, £, and ¥ in our
money, their specter crosses our paths to freedom.</p>

<p lingdex="25">Dreaming of some day shooting our aspirations off into space could deaden
our sense of responsibility here on Earth. We have a nasty habit of fouling
our nests and moving on. The USA’s National Aeronautic and Space
Administration (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>) has jettisoned the
phrase, “To understand and protect our home planet” from its <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0722-01.htm">mission
statement</a>. Already, near space is loaded with so much obsolete electronic
<a href="http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question22.html">junk</a>
and astronauts’ end products that NASA Space Shuttles and the International
Space Station have to dodge or get a fatal hole. We’ve placed our cultural
icons on the moon: a flag, a golf ball, and an abandoned vehicle. </p>

<p lingdex="26">Before we seek out new worlds and boldly go where no human has gone
before, we have an obligation to clean up our messes on this world.</p>

<p lingdex="27">Let’s be grateful we don’t live on the moon or in space. Our personal
castles on Earth may not be much, but our efforts often make them garden
sanctuaries a thousand times nicer than luxury quarters in a giant tin can
drifting in space. </p>

Stephen Hawking’s <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/21570">opinion:</a>
“I believe that the long-term future of the human race must be in space. It
will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in the next
hundred years, let alone the next thousand, or million. The human race
shouldn’t have all its eggs in one basket, or on one planet. Let’s hope
we can avoid dropping the basket until we have spread the load.” <br>

<p lingdex="32"><a name="spread"></a><b>Q: If we spread life to other planets, wouldn’t
there be more chance for it to survive?</b></p>

<p lingdex="33">At first, spreading life might sound like a noble idea. British explorer
Captain Cook would offer Pacific islands chiefs a breeding pair of pigs, and
was disgusted by the ignorance of some primitives who just slaughtered the
gifts for a luau. Yum, European exotic invader. . . Cook, et all. Feral pigs
are still negatively impacting ecosystems in Hawai’i and elsewhere.</p>

<p lingdex="34">Our experience here on Earth with exotic species devastating ecosystems
should give adequate warning of the folly of introducing species to other
seemingly-uninhabited planets. Take starlings and house sparrows... please.
Folks who blessed North America with all the birds from Shakespeare’s works
thought they were on a righteous mission—sort of like the fantasy of
spreading Earth life all over the Universe might be.</p>

<p lingdex="35">It’s not impossible that someday we may be able to create conditions on
some lifeless orbiting rock to support life as we imagine it could be. We
could also find lifeless places right here and restore them to ecological
integrity. Chernobyl, Hanford, and other death zones would be good starts.
Perhaps before we figure on terra-forming elsewhere we ought to stop
terra-deforming here.</p>

<p lingdex="36">Down-to-Earth solutions exist already—we only need to use them, coupled
with improved birth rates on a global scale. Adjustments of our priorities
could create a wonderful world for all life. It starts with each of us making
responsible choices.</p>
