concept</b></font>

<p lingdex="0">with comments from Les U. Knight sometimes in between</p></center>

<p lingdex="1">Millions of people around the planet have independently arrived at
the conclusion that Earth's biosphere would be better off without
humans, or that we should at least stop breeding for now.</p>

<p lingdex="2">Most have never heard of VHEMT. The following is but a sample of
the many messages received which are in agreement with, or are in
support of, the VHEMT concept.<br>

<p lingdex="4">On December 19th, 1998, _The Economist_ magazine agreed with VHEMT
in a <a href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=179963">two-page
spread</a>.<br>
<br>
Here's a little of what it says:</p>

<p lingdex="5"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;</font><font size="+1" color="#CC3333"><b>Sui
genocide</b></font><font color="#CC3333"><br>
<br>
"The human species might yet fulfill its evolutionary potential, if
it would only go away. In the end, there is only the fiery quantum
pit or the heatless grey soup. It is, far and away, the greatest act
of goodness ever contemplated.<br>
<br>
"HOW, if at all, will the 1990s be remembered? The Internet rose and
the Soviet Union fell. Mammals were cloned, Bosnia broke up, and
peace came to Ireland, maybe. Something happened in Canada, though no
one was sure precisely what. On the whole it has been a decade like
any other, agreeably dull. In a thousand years, or in ten thousand or
a hundred thousand, what will matter? Mainly an event which hardly
anyone noticed at the time: the first, tentative sprouting of an idea
which can transfigure humanity.<br>
<br>
"Thank--if you think it cause for thanks--Les U. Knight of Portland,
Oregon. Great ideas sometimes have peculiar beginnings, and Mr Knight
is a case in point."<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000">Are they calling me peculiar?<br>
</font><font color="#CC3333"><br>
"It is hard, indeed, to imagine any reason to be against voluntary
human extinction. The tricky question is not whether to extinguish,
but when."<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#000000">No time like the present.<br>
<br>
One slight correction: the article states,
</font><font color="#CC3333">"Around 1970, when he was back from
service in the Vietnam war . . ." </font><font color="#000000">For
clarity, that should read ". . . service <b>during</b> the Vietnam
war. . ." I've never been to Vietnam. Les</font></p>

<p lingdex="34"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;but don't you agree that educating
ignorant people, like the ones sabatoging our earth might
help?&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="35">Well, sort of. The ones doing the most damage are extremely rich
and powerful. I think they know what they are doing, but believe that
the money they are making is worth sacrificing other life forms for.
Charles Hurwitz, for example: his Maxxam Corporation is liquidating
redwoods thousands of years old. Will education help him?</p>

<p lingdex="36">Each of us, expecially in the over-industrialized world, have a
high impact no matter how educated we are. True, we can limit our
consumption, and make wise choices based on our education, but I
seriously doubt we can have a net positive influence on the
ecosphere. We can be a net positive influence on humanity if we
try.</p>

<p lingdex="37"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;although, some people spew off pure
stupidity and will never understand how to care for such a thing as
the earth, let alone their children.but if we can get a hold of their
children before they can enfore their moronic views on them maybe we
have a chance. &lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="38">Yes, raising awareness is the whole idea. Some folks might seem
like lost causes, and if they've already made their heirs, it's sort
of moot. However, I think everyone has the potential for realizing
that the best way to help humanity and Earth's biosphere is to
refrain from creating any more of us -- at least for the time
being.</p>

<p lingdex="39"><font color="#CC3333">&gt; well that was my opinion. i am really
not for or against it, YET. i will still have to ponder upon the
thought of VHEMT. thanks for your view points. it really made me
think.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="40">That's what I can success. Thoughtful disagreement is better than
mindless agreement.</p>

<p lingdex="41"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;searching for an answer,&lt;</font></p>
		<p lingdex="42">I am searching for answers too, lots of them. I'd like to say that
voluntarily phasing out the human race is THE answer, but it's only
one answer. It's not even a very likely solution: convincing six
billion people to stop breeding is a rather daunting task.</p>

Your point that people already come to this conclusion before
visiting your site was spot on in my case, having been feeling
totally uneasy about the current state of the world for some time
now. My problem is trying to convince other people of the mess that
we're in though. Virtually none of my peers are really interested,
too busy enjoying themselves in the here and now to worry about
bigger issues, and if I'm brutally honest, I'm a tad jealous of their
ignorance. Neros, fiddling whilst Rome burns. Your ideas which I feel
to be pretty reasonable would be extremely difficult to get across to
others as they go so much against the norm, but I'll give it a

		<p lingdex="52"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Before I give you my reason, I would
like to tell you that for a a while, now, I have believed this
Nation, and this World are overpopulated. I also realize, that many
don't care, or don't want to believe it. I happened upon your site,
b/c I am doing a controversial essay for English. I must say, some of
the sites I have visited sicken me. Some people, mostly
enviromentalists, believe the only way to help the earth is to create
more people. &lt; </font></p>

<p lingdex="53">Strange, isn't it? I know what you mean, people who consider
themselves environmentally aware still plan on producing two new
people. I guess they think that the first two have no environmental
impact.</p>

<p lingdex="54">If six billion of us aren't enough to get the job done, seven
won't be any better.</p>

<p lingdex="55"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;I understand the many reasons for
overpopulation, and I would definitelly love to help if there is
anything I can do. &lt; </font></p>

<p lingdex="56">Sometimes helping Earth's other life forms is as much a matter of
what we don't do as do do. In this case, your deciding to not add
more of us to the billions does a lot of good.</p>

<p lingdex="57">Besides not breeding, the choice of what to do to help is yours.
There are many worthwhile directions to go in. Not all Volunteers
actively promote voluntary human extinction. Raising awareness is
about all VHEMT does right now, the rest is up to various
organizations set up to actually do something: reproductive freedom,
ecological protection and restoration, and so on. If you'd like to
help promote VHEMT, you could display one of our bumper stickers or
wear our T-shirt. We're getting buttons soon. Directing interested
people to the VHEMT website is also a good method.</p>

<p lingdex="58"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;I would like to, at this time, tell you
that I am 16 years old. I don't know if that is in any interest of
you, but I thought it might be. &lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="59">Yes and no. I'm opposed to ageism, but at the same time I'm
encouraged by people arriving at this conclusion early in life.
You're not the youngest Volunteer or Supporter in VHEMT. I think the
youngest subscriber to our sharing and discussion list is 15, but I
don't know and I don't care. Age seems to be rather irrelevant to our
levels of awareness.</p>

<p lingdex="60"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Before happening upon your site, I had
planned to have 2 children, right now that idea has changed to zero.
I believe in this site.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="61">Thank you very much, Kay. That's very good to hear. You might be
the first person I know of to change from two to zero just by reading
the VHEMT site. I often hear from people who already arrived at this
conclusion, and from those who were leaning this way and made the
final leap, but it's rare to achieve a "conversion".</p>

<p lingdex="62"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Now the reason I am writing. Why breed?
I believe in this site, and I think it has a very good goal, to a
point. I believe that the poeple of today should stop breeding, but
in the future, before we become "extinct," we need to start again.
&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="63">You're not alone in thinking this. VHEMT Supporters, as distinct
from Volunteers, are not in favor of our extinction. Generally,
Supporters agree that the intentional creation of one more of us by
anyone anywhere can't be justified today, but maybe when our density
is improved enough to be sustainable, we can rethink our
breeding.</p>

<p lingdex="64">I shared your message with our private discussion list, and a
Supporter responded: "I would just like to say that this is what we
need more of in the world. Often we're too busy reading about the
"Die @!$*" or the "%$#* you" that we don't realize that the potty
mouths are getting all the spot light and that the people doing
something about it (overpopulation) are left in the cold. I
personally believe that we should breed again when the population
stabilizes, but we don't have to worry about that for a good long
while. Again, way to go Kay!!!"</p>

<p lingdex="65">(He's referring to <a href="http://vhemt.org/disagreements.htm">disagreeable
messages</a> from website visitors which include pointless
obscenities).</p>

<p lingdex="66"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;I know that we may end up making the
same mistake again, but (with no religious aspect what-so-ever) who's
to say for sure that we would evolve again? I don't really see the
point of becoming extinct. I really don't see the point of life, but
with no poeple I see the point of animals, the earth, and everything
else even more pointless. &lt; </font></p>

<p lingdex="67">On one philosophical level, I have to agree that existence only
has whatever meaning we give it: our lives only have a point if we
give it one. This line of reasoning can lead one to nihilism,
depression, and even suicide -- unless one goes all the way through
to the other side. By choosing one of the thousands of possible
purposes for our lives, we actually achieve a point to life.</p>

<p lingdex="68"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;We must be here for some reason,
&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="69">Would this requre some metaphysical intelligence such as a diety,
or an intelligence behind Nature? My personal view is that we do have
a reason for being here, and it's up to us to decide what that is.
Voluntary extinction of the human race is my life's work, though I
know I'll never see the day there are none of us on Earth. Maybe my
point is pointless. ;-)</p>

<p lingdex="70"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;and if we become extinct, and we don't
evolve again, why have the earth, the animals, and the food. &lt;
</font></p>
		<p lingdex="71">By taking an Earth-centered view of the entire biosphere, we can
be seen as simply one of the millions of other life forms. If we
decide that our existence has no point, that's our choice. But I
don't think we have the right to make that decision for other life
forms, as we are doing when we cause their extinctions.</p>

		<p lingdex="75"><font color="#CC3333">&nbsp;My entire life I've wanted to be a
mother, I wanted to care for someone and love and raise them.&nbsp;So
when I got married, the next "logical" step was to try to procreate.
after 4 years of "unproductive sex" my husband and I were branded as
infertile and given the name of the local fertility specialist. It
was then that I really realized that this wasn't what I wanted at
all.&nbsp; I decided then that what mattered to me was not physically
having a baby, what I really was trying to do was "fit in" I wanted
to have that perfect life, the husband, the career, the kids, the
house ......&nbsp; my infertility made me realize that getting
pregnant isn't and will never be the path to the perfect life. I
opened my eyes and began to see all the things that I thought I
wanted or the things that I was doing were things that society had
trained me to want and do.&nbsp; So my husband and I began live our
lives the way we wanted to. We gave away all of our baby stuff we had
aquired with the hope of a pregnancy, our families and friends saying
we were crazy, and looking at us with pity saying things like "don't
worry, you'll have one someday..." or "You will be missing out if you
don't have a baby" what they didn't understand was that I looked at
my infertility as a turning point in my life.&nbsp; I felt lucky to
not be able to conceive because I was finally able to look at the
world around me with unclouded "society driven" vision. I became
aware of all the children out there (human or animal) that needed my
love and care, and I began to wonder why I had ever wanted to create
another person that this world really didn't have room for just to
satify my need to nurture. I am currently the mother of 4 beautiful
creatures all of them needed&nbsp;loving homes and someone to care
for them.&nbsp; we have 2 cats, litter mates who were going to be
"set free" in a field as kittens because of an unwanted litter.&nbsp;
an old (15 years) strange looking&nbsp;dog that weighs about 5 lbs
soaking wet, who we adopted from a family member who didn't want her
anymore, and a 1year old cocker spaniel who was dropped off at the
humane society because his previous owners were moving to an
apartment that didn't allow dogs (to that I say, if you had a 1 year
old child, would you put him up for adoption so that you could move
into a "really cool" apartment that didn't allow children? I think
not!!) I would love to hear the pitter patter of two footed animals
sometime, but I want them to need me, I don't want to have to create
them to need me. (does this make sense?)</font></p>

<p lingdex="76"><font color="#CC3333">So here I am at the beginning of what I
consider to be a spiritual journey, along which, I come across your
website. At first, it struck me as funny, the voluntary extinction of
one's own species, and doing so in such a non violent, loving, even
logical manner.&nbsp; Yet I have to ask, why extinction? my number 1
issue, is that extinction by not breeding is going to be impossible
at best to achive voluntarily.&nbsp; Human kind rarely does anything
(or does not do anything as the case may be) without force of some
kind. so with the impossiblity in mind, why not try to change
humankind into a more ecologically responsible species? I agree 110%
that humans are the #1 cause of the earth's (our own and other
lifeform's) destruction.&nbsp; But it seems like extinction would be
the easy way out (theoretically speaking). Don't procreate, become
extinct and the earth gets to repopulate with less descructive life
forms.&nbsp; But being the selfish homosapien that I am, I rather
like the thought of us frolicking in green meadows with our fellow
life forms.</font></p>

<p lingdex="77"><font color="#CC3333">now, I don't know many statistics, or facts
about the world's ecological state, however, it seems that it took us
a while to get where we are now.&nbsp; And granted it will take us
much longer to undo it. but if there was a way for us to live on this
earth and continue to multiply (within reason) and not threaten the
earth or the lifeforms living on or around it,&nbsp; that would be a
much better goal to work towards I would think.</font></p>

<p lingdex="78"><font color="#CC3333">I do agree that breeding of humans at this
time is assanine.&nbsp; I think that we need to take care of what we
have right now meaning the children who are being neglected or abused
or otherwise need parenting. no matter what we do there will be some
people who insist upon reproducing themselves, and will continue to
do so unless forced not to.&nbsp; I guess both of our goals are the
same, we both want there to be harmony and goodness on the earth and
we both feel that something must be done yet in a non forcefull,
voluntary manner. I just hope that more people realize what we are
doing to the earth and the inhabitants of it and they learn that they
must take a step forward in preventing any more destruction.&nbsp; I
think a good step right now is to slow, stop or decrease the human
population, take care of and raise the children that we already have
to become healty, happy, ecologically responsible humans.</font></p>

mutation, our brain capacity surpassed our physical strength and i
think we've just gotten too smart and screwed things up. I have never
wanted to have kids becuase i really believe that there are too many
people in the world. By the way, i'm fifteen. Anyway, i think people
should still be able to have sex, there just shouldn't end up being a
kid. or maybe only the "best" people should have kids. People who are
mentally fit as well as physically. Race shouldn't matter. Also i
want to stop religion. That is a bunch of bullshit. People should
admit they were wrong and realize that there is no god. We should be
believing in ourselves, not in some figment of the imagination
perfected over thousands of years.</font></p>

notion that we all don't Need
to</font><font size="-1" color="#CC3333">
</font><font color="#CC3333">Breed. My husband and I aren't going
that route, for many fine reasons and I certainly wish others would
see the wisdom of this choice. Coming from a large Irish Catholic
family, you can imagine my fatigue with
having</font><font size="-1" color="#CC3333">
</font><font color="#CC3333">to explain it all. I mean, do people
actually READ the paper or LISTEN
to</font><font size="-1" color="#CC3333">
</font><font color="#CC3333">the news and just not friggin' GET IT?
The Vatican is a large
corporation,</font><font size="-1" color="#CC3333">
</font><font color="#CC3333">and makes its income from its "sheep"
tithing their 10% and creating the next generation to tithe their 10%
and so on, and so on...ad nauseum.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="119">You're not alone in your reluctance to support full voluntary
extinction: many consider themselves VHEMT Supporters, which means
they agree that the intentional creation of one more of us by anyone
anywhere can't be justified at this time, but promoting extinction of
our species just goes too far for them.</p>

<p lingdex="120">We have a long way to go: the choice to not breed has to be
defended when it should be rewarded. Tax credits, multiplied by as
many offspring as a couple chooses to create, shows that pronatalism
is official government policy. Maybe it's the same mentality of the
Church: more sheep to tithe.</p>

<p lingdex="121">There's much to do in many directions: promotion of childfree
living, reproductive freedom, local land-use issues, and so on. Even
doing nothing does more good than adding to the problem.</p>

<p lingdex="122"><font color="#CC3333">&gt; I hear alot about saving Mother Earth.
What crap. Mother Earth is perfectly capable of taking care of
herself. When she has had enough, and yes that time approacheth, she
will shrug us off like a dog does fleas, maybe via floods, or another
ice age or whatever choice we leave her. This is, of course, unfair
to the millions of species we share this space with - innocent
victims of our irresponsibility. &lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="123">I fear your Cassandra-like prophesy is more likely, based on a
rough calculation of the time left, current level of awareness,
willingness of the wealthiest 10% to allow change, and so on.</p>

<p lingdex="124"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;So, keep up the message...at least in
terms of curtailing this breeding explosion. I wish I more hope that
it was reaching people. I've discovered that much of our country's
population is comprised of followers, people who don't think for
themselves and allow the various religions to tell them what to do.
In the end, ironically, it will be "god" that destroys
humankind.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="125">Unless we get in touch with whatever "god" we got inside and short
circuit the process. Although it's unlikely we'll be able to convince
six billion people to refrain from further breeding, I see this as
the best alternative to the massive die off we are engineering for
ourselves and all life.</p>

&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="166">No, you certainly aren't alone. There must be millions of people
around the planet independently arriving at the awareness that
Earth's biosphere would be better off without humans. Most don't
speak English, so I'll probably never hear from them.</p>

<p lingdex="167"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Up to now, only my poor, beleaguered
wife has listened to me fulminate against the human race and call for
a new incurable plague rendering us all infertile (actually, I
inflict the same rants on the family at holiday dinners -- cheers,
everyone!).&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="168">Yeah, I quit doing that when everyone began rolling their eyes and
sighing loudly as if to say, "Here we go again." They stop listening
after a while -- after a very short time, actually. Maybe half a
sentence if it sounds like something they don't agree with. They
begin looking for a trash can in their minds: "Let's see, is it the
misanthrope trash? Maybe the baby-hater trash can. Yeah. Did anyone
watch Seinfeld last night?"</p>

<p lingdex="169">I agree that the best thing that could happen to Earth would be
for all Homo sapiens sperm to lose viability forever. Sure, sperm
counts are down world wide, but that hasn't slowed our growth much if
at all. I wouldn't credit it with the drop from 90+ million per year
to the estimated 80 million present growth. People are saying the
population explosion is over because of this little dip. As one
population activist commented, just because the tidal wave is 80 feet
high instead of 90 is not cause for celebration.</p>

<p lingdex="170">Unless some space alien joins forces with us, that global
infertility dream is going to remain a dream. We have to take other
steps. I've chosen awareness. I like to believe I've prevented a few
humans from being conceived -- gives me a warm feeling.</p>

<p lingdex="171"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Now I see I'm not alone. That's good. My
feeling is, humans are such a savage, cruel race, it's best if we all
disappear; but since I'm such a sensitive kinda guy, I don't want to
see people suffer, which is why I don't give thanks for AIDS or war.
Much better to have the infertility plague. This is also important
because if we were to all die tomorrow, the millions of animals kept
as pets or locked in zoos, circuses, etc. would die of starvation and
related causes, which, since I'm an animal rights kinda guy, also
doesn't jive with my philosophy. Thus, slow elimination (not unlike a
meat-eater's colon). &lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="172">Exactly. We've got a lot of messes to clean up before we check
out. Phasing out ourselves and other domesticated animals is a humane
approach.</p>

<p lingdex="173"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Now let's see if you agree with me on
this one: sometimes people will say to me, "If you feel that way
about it, why not put your money where you mouth is and kill
yourself?" Well, I might, but not before everyone else does. Why?
Because I'm one of the better people, dammit. I try my best not to
harm people or animals or the earth. Let the hunters and factory
farmers and real estate developers kill themselves first. When all
the creeps are gone, I'll join in...maybe. Or maybe I'll just have a
party with the other rare do-gooders of this sad Earth and grow old
and die with them. Yeah, that works.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="174">Although the above works logically, I wouldn't use it because the
next charge fired at me would be "Elitism!" As if our exhaust don't
stink. I prefer to say that we'll all be dead soon enough. Shaving a
few years off our lives will do little if anything to alleviate
population pressure. Each of us is only one six billionth of the
problem.</p>

<p lingdex="175">On the other hand, creating a new human with a whole life ahead of
it has a tremendous environmental impact, especially here in North
America. It also has the potential to replicate itself. No,
increasing death won't help reduce the population, but contraception
will.</p>
		<p lingdex="176">One of the first things that we need is reproductive freedom for
all. When every couple has the means to avoid conception, birth rates
will drop. Perhaps not enough to stop our increase, but with
awareness efforts and a ceasing of pronatalist encouragements, we
will be a long way toward voluntarily reducing our density.</p>

thought provoking to say the least.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="179">Thank you for your encouragement. I'm glad you enjoyed reading
about VHEMT and found it thought provoking - that's the main idea.
With almost 60% of conceptions in North America unintended, simply
getting people to think before they breed would be a major
advancement.</p>

<p lingdex="180"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;I thought my mother was the only person
on the planet against destroying the earth with over-population, I
was wrong.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="181">It may not be talked about much, but there are millions of people
who are aware that Earth's biosphere can't support six billion Homo
sapiens. Most of them still think we can turn things around if people
will stop at one or two offspring, but we really don't have that much
time to play with. Due to the momentum of population growth, even a
global birth rate of one would not achieve zero population growth
right away. In China, their numbers are still increasing in spite of
their strict policy of one child per couple.</p>

<p lingdex="182"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;Even though you have answered every
question and retort anyone could possible put forth, there's still
one thing I don't understand. It seems to me that ignorant people
breed more than those of a slightly higher capability.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="183">Perhaps so, but ignorance can be cured.</p>

<p lingdex="184"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;If stupid people are the ones who breed
how will they ever understand why they are supposed to stop making
babies? or at least limit themselves to one or two?&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="185">It takes very little intelligence to realize that the intentional
creation of one more of us by anyone anywhere can't be justified at
this time.</p>

<p lingdex="186">Fortunately, VHEMT is an idea and doesn't have to be inherited
genetically. All of us came from breeding couples, and yet we've
decided to stop breeding.</p>

<p lingdex="187"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;I asked my mom this question and she
laughingly said we should slip birth control into their food while
they're not looking.&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="188">The first step would be to make sure that everyone has free access
to contraceptives. Even here in North America, restrictions on
reproductive freedom are increasing. They aren't being outlawed,
exactly, but as the Catholic Church buys more hospitals and HMOs,
contraceptive methods are eliminated. This is ironic, to say the
least, because contraception nips abortion in the bud.</p>

<p lingdex="189"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;(Religion is the reason we are in the
mess we're in; it all starts with those major orginizations. They
still to this day tell people to have kids. &lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="190">They're not the only ones: this whole society is pronatalist. Now
presidential candidates are talking about doubling the "baby bounty"
to $1000 each. Our tax money subsidizes irresponsible reproductive
choices.</p>

<p lingdex="191"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;They're also the most unconcerned about
life on this planet now and after. Since they're all going to
'heaven' why should they care what happens to future
generations?)&lt;</font></p>

<p lingdex="192">Rather than religions, I think it's churches that are the problem.
A religion is a belief system that includes advice to be responsible.
A church, on the other hand, might only watch out for its own
welfare, like breeding more members.</p>

<p lingdex="193">Yes, the belief in an after life, coupled with a belief that this
world is just a temporary stopping off place on the way there, can
cause people to care little for what happens to the ecosphere.
However, there are plenty of religious folks who care about
Nature.</p>

<p lingdex="194"><font color="#CC3333">&gt;maybe we're not supposed to heal the
world but only heal ourselves and a few other people&lt;</font></p>
		<p lingdex="195">We, and a few other people, are also the world. It would be nice
if we could heal the world, but that's a rather daunting task -
almost as challenging as convincing six billion people to stop
breeding. What we really need to do is stop destroying Earth's
ecosystems, then maybe we can help them heal and expand. As long as
our numbers increase, and thus our demands increase, we will have a
hard time making things better.</p>

intelligence to figure out our alphabet, the English language and
from there it'll probably go on to building roads and power stations.
Then, hopefully, the monkey will realise that its species is fucking
up the planet and will go the "Way of the humans" (A semi-mythical
species of primates who built cities and transport networks way back
when the monkey was still a simple tree-dweller). How the HELL did I

<p lingdex="223">Yes, I think this is the best we can do: undo, mitigate, restore,
and try to help the lives which are harmed by our continued

<p lingdex="225">I regularly hear from people who state that Earth is here for us

see a fellow believer in the true healing method of the
planet!!</font></p>

<p lingdex="258">Now, all we have to do is convince another 6,050,000,000 humans.

<p lingdex="259"><font color="#CC3333">Thank you for trying to spread some sense
into the billions of drones that mindlessly destroy the earth in
their throw-away consumerist society. Well, first let me introduce
myself.....my name is Sean and I am a biology student on the East
Coast. I used to think that our planet would be ok in the long run
and would always find a way to bounce (or fight) back and to stay in
balance. However, I now fear that human advances in technology will
override Earth's natural protection and all will be lost. I envision
an Earth covered in mile-high skyscrapers to house the 15-20 billion
people projected by 2050. How will we ever feed them?!?!? Why do
people always ignore the underlying cause of all of our environmental
problems?? Population studies are largely ignored. </font></p>

<p lingdex="260">Thanks for the encouragement. Yes, even those who study biology
often ignore the obvious. It seems to be a blind spot in our
thinking.</p>

<p lingdex="261">What would you estimate the odds are that we have already passed
the point of no return toward a major ecological collapse? By that I
mean one that will eliminate all complex, or higher order species
such as ourselves.</p>

<p lingdex="262"><font color="#CC3333">Something needs to change, and people like
you are definitely trailblazers. I applaude you and good luck in
future activies with VHEMT. </font></p>
		<p lingdex="263">We can try. Convincing six billion people to stop breeding does
seem like a rather daunting task. Most of them don't even speak
English. The odds may be against voluntary human extinction, but
there's too much at stake to just give up and let humanity take its
course.</p>
